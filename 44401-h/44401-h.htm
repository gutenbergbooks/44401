<h1 title="">THE PHANTOM YACHT</h1>
<h2 id="c1"><br />CHAPTER I.
<br />FRIENDS PARTED</h2>
<p>The face of Dories Moore was as dismal as the
day was bright. It was Indian summer and the
maple trees under which she was hurrying were
joyfully arrayed in red and gold, while crimson,
yellow and purple flowers nodded at her from the
gardens that she passed with unseeing eyes. She
was almost blinded with tears; her scarlet tam was
awry, as though she had put it on hurriedly, and her
sweater coat, of the same cheerful hue, was unbuttoned
and flapping as she fairly ran down the village
street. In her hand was a note which had been the
cause of the tears and the haste. On it were a few
penciled words:</p>
<p class="tb">&ldquo;Dori dear, we are leaving sooner than we expected.
I&rsquo;m sending this to you by little Johnnie-next-door.
Do come right over and say good-bye
to someone who loves you best of all.</p>
<p><span class="center">&ldquo;Your sister-friend,</span>
<span class="jr">&ldquo;<span class="sc">Nann</span>.&rdquo;</span></p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_4">[4]</div>
<p class="tb">At a large old colonial house at the edge of the
town, just where the meadows began, the girl turned
in at a lilac-guarded gate and hurried up the neatly
graveled walk. Her eyes were again brimming with
tears as she glanced up at the curtainless windows
that looked as dismal and deserted as she felt.
Hurrying up the steps, she lifted the quaintly
carved old iron knocker and shuddered as she heard
the sound echoing uncannily through the big unfurnished
rooms. Her sensitive mouth quivered
when she heard the sound of running feet on bare
floors and when the door was flung open by another
girl of about the same age, Dori leaped in and,
throwing her arms about her friend, she burst into
tears.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, Dories! Dear, dear Dori, don&rsquo;t cry so
hard.&rdquo; There were sudden tears in the warm
brown eyes of Nann Sibbett, as for a moment she
held her friend tenderly close.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One might think that I was going a million miles
away.&rdquo; She tried to speak cheerfully. &ldquo;Boston isn&rsquo;t
so very far from Elmwood and some day, soon, I
am sure that you will be coming to visit me.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_5">[5]</div>
<p>An April-like smile flickered tremulously on the
lips of the younger girl as she stepped back and
straightened her tam. &ldquo;Well, that is something to
look forward to,&rdquo; she confessed. &ldquo;It will be a little
strip of silver lining to as black a cloud as ever
came into my life. Of course,&rdquo; Dories amended,
&ldquo;losing father was terrible, but I was too young to
know the loneliness of it, and being poor when we
should be rich is awfully hard. Sometimes I feel so
rebellious, O, nobody knows how rebellious I feel.
But losing one&rsquo;s money is nothing compared to
losing one&rsquo;s only friend.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The other girl, who was taller by half a head,
actually laughed. &ldquo;Why, Dories Moore, here you
talk as though you would not have a single friend
left when I have moved away. There isn&rsquo;t a girl at
High who hasn&rsquo;t been green with envy because I
have had the good fortune to be your best friend
ever since we were in kindergarten, and just as soon
as I&rsquo;m out of town they&rsquo;ll be swarming around you,
each one aspiring to be your pal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a scornful curl on the sensitive lips of
the listener. &ldquo;As though I would let anyone have
your place, Nann Sibbett. Never, never, never, not
if I live to be a thousand years old.&rdquo; Then with an
appealing upward glance, &ldquo;But you&rsquo;ll probably like
some city girl heaps better than you ever did me.
I suppose you&rsquo;ll forget all about me soon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Silly!&rdquo; Nann exclaimed brightly, giving her
friend an impulsive hug. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you remember
when you were eleven and I was twelve, we had a
ceremony out in the meadow under the twin elms
and we vowed, just as solemnly as we knew how,
that we would be adopted sisters and that real born
sisters could not be closer.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_6">[6]</div>
<p>Dories nodded, smiling again at the pleasant
recollection. &ldquo;Do you know, Nann,&rdquo; she put in, &ldquo;I
sort of feel that we were intended to be sisters some
way. It was such a strange coincidence that our
birthdays happened to fall on the same day, the
third of September.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe if they hadn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; Nann chimed in, &ldquo;you
and I wouldn&rsquo;t have been best friends at all, for,
don&rsquo;t you remember, way back in kindergarten days,
you were so shy you didn&rsquo;t make friends with anyone,
and when Miss Sally wanted to find a seat for
you that very first morning, she chose me because it
was our birthday. After that, since I was a year
older, I felt that I ought to look out for you just as
a big sister really should.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dories nodded, then as she glanced into the bare
library, in the wide doorway of which they were
standing, she said dismally, &ldquo;O, Nann, what good
times we&rsquo;ve had in this room. I can almost see now
when we were very little girls curled up on that
window seat near the fireplace studying our first
primer, and on and on until last June when we were
cramming for our sophomore finals.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_7">[7]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I know.&rdquo; Nann looked wistfully toward the
corner which Dories had indicated. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe
we will either of us know how to study alone.&rdquo;
Then, fearing that tears would come again, she
caught her friend&rsquo;s hand as she exclaimed, &ldquo;Dories
dear, this room is too full of ghosts of our past.
Let&rsquo;s go out in the garden. Dad had to go to the
bank to finish up some business, and I had to stay
here to see that the last load of furniture got off
safely. It left just before you came. We&rsquo;re going
to store it for a time and live in a very fine hotel in
Boston. Won&rsquo;t that be a lark for a change?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dories spoke bitterly, &ldquo;Well, for one thing I <i>am</i>
thankful, and that is that your father didn&rsquo;t lose his
money the way my father did, though how it happened
I never knew and mother never told me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe it will all come back some time in a manner
just as mysterious,&rdquo; her friend said cheerfully
as she led her down the steps around the house.
Neither of the girls spoke of Nann&rsquo;s dear mother,
who had so recently died, and whose passing had
made life in the old house unendurable to the
daughter and her father, but they were both thinking
of her as they wandered into the garden which
she had so loved. Nann slipped an arm about her
friend as she paused to look at the blossoms.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_8">[8]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Autumn flowers are always so bright and cheerful,
aren&rsquo;t they, Dori?&rdquo; She was determined to
change the younger girl&rsquo;s dismal trend of thought.
&ldquo;That bed of scarlet salvia over by the evergreen
hedge seems to be just rejoicing about something,
and the asters, of almost every color, look as though
they were dressed for a party. They&rsquo;re happy, if
we aren&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stupid things!&rdquo; Dories said petulantly. &ldquo;They
don&rsquo;t know or care because you, who have tended
and watered and loved them, are going away forever
and ever.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, they do know,&rdquo; Nann said, smiling a bit
tremulously, &ldquo;for last night when I came out to give
them a drink, I told them all about it, but they&rsquo;re
just trying to make the best of it. They know it&rsquo;s
as hard for me to go away from my old home as it is
for them to have me go, but they&rsquo;re trying to make
it easier for me, I guess.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dories flashed a quick glance up at her companion.
Then, impulsively, &ldquo;Oh, Nann, how selfish I always
am! Of course it&rsquo;s hard for you to leave your old
home and go among strangers. Here all the time
I&rsquo;ve just been thinking how <i>hard</i> it is for <i>me</i> to have
you go.&rdquo; Then, making a little bow toward the bed
of radiant asters, the girl of many moods called to
them: &ldquo;You&rsquo;re setting a good example, you little
plant folk in your bright blossom tams. From now
on I&rsquo;ll be just as cheerful as ever I can.&rdquo; Smiling
up at her companion, Dories exclaimed, &ldquo;And all
this time I&rsquo;ve had some news that I haven&rsquo;t told
you.&rdquo; Answering verbally her friend&rsquo;s questioning
look, she hurried on, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going away myself for
the month of October. At least I suppose I am, and
that&rsquo;s one of the things that has made me so dismally
blue.&rdquo; Nann stopped in the garden path
which they had been slowly circling and gazed into
the pretty face of her friend, hardly knowing
whether to congratulate or condole. Instead of
doing either, she queried, &ldquo;But why are you so dismal
about it, Dori? I&rsquo;ve often heard you say that
you did wish you could see something of the world
beyond Elmwood?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_9">[9]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I know it and I still should wish it if you were
going with me, but this journey is anything but
pleasant to anticipate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do tell me about it. I&rsquo;m consumed with curiosity.&rdquo;
Nann drew her friend to a garden seat and
sat with an arm holding her close. &ldquo;Now start at
the beginning. <i>Who</i> are you going with, where and
why?&rdquo; The question, simple as it seemed, brought
tears with a rush to the violet-blue eyes of the
younger girl, but remembering her recent resolve,
she sat up ramrod-straight as she replied, making
her mouth into as hard a line as she could. &ldquo;The
one I am going with is an old crab of a great-aunt
whom I have never seen. I&rsquo;m ever so sure she is a
crab, although my angel mother always smooths
over that part of her nature when she&rsquo;s telling me
about her. She&rsquo;s rich as Cr&oelig;sus, if that fabled person
really was rich. I&rsquo;m never very sure about
those things.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_10">[10]</div>
<p>Nann laughed. &ldquo;He was! You&rsquo;re safe in your
comparison. But he got much of his money by taking
it away from other people with the cruel taxes
he levied.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, well, of course my Great Aunt Jane isn&rsquo;t so
terribly rich,&rdquo; Dories modified, &ldquo;but Mother said she
had plenty for every comfort and luxury, and
what&rsquo;s more, Mums <i>did</i> agree with <i>me</i> when I said
that she must be queer. That is, Mother said that
even my father, who was Great-Aunt Jane&rsquo;s own
nephew, couldn&rsquo;t understand her ways.&rdquo; Then,
with eyes solemn-wide, the narrator continued:
&ldquo;Nann Sibbett, as I&rsquo;ve often told you, I don&rsquo;t understand
in the least what became of our inheritance.
If Mother knows, she won&rsquo;t tell, but I&rsquo;m suspicious
of that crabby old Aunt Jane. I think she has it.
There now, that&rsquo;s what I think.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nann was interested and said so. &ldquo;But, Dori
dear, you&rsquo;ve sidetracked. You began by saying that
you were going somewhere. I take it that your
Great-Aunt Jane has invited you to go somewhere
with her. Is that right?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_11">[11]</div>
<p>&ldquo;It is!&rdquo; the other girl said glumly. &ldquo;But, believe
me, I don&rsquo;t look forward to the excursion with any
great pleasure.&rdquo; Then she hurried on. &ldquo;Think of
it, Nann, that awful old lady has actually requested
that I spend the whole dismal month of October
with her down on the beach at some lonely isolated
place called Siquaw Point.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But if Dories expected sympathy, she was disappointed.
&ldquo;Oh, Dori!&rdquo; was the excited exclamation
that she heard, &ldquo;I know about Siquaw Point.
An aunt of mine went there one summer, and she
just raved about the rocky cliffs, the sand dunes and
the sea. I&rsquo;d love it, I know, even in the middle of
winter, and, dear, sometimes October is a beautiful
month. You may have a wonderful time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Dories refused to see any hope of happiness
ahead. &ldquo;The Garden of Eden would be a dismal
place to me if I had to be alone in it with my Great-Aunt
Jane.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nann laughed, then hearing a siren calling from
the front, she sprang up, held out both hands to her
friend as she exclaimed, &ldquo;There&rsquo;s my chauffeur-dad
waiting to bear me stationward, but, dear, I&rsquo;ve
thought of one thing that will help some. To get to
Siquaw Point you will have to go through Boston.
If you&rsquo;ll let me know the day and the hour I&rsquo;ll be at
the station to speed you on your way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>How the younger girl&rsquo;s face brightened. &ldquo;Nann,
darling,&rdquo; she exclaimed, &ldquo;will you truly? Then
that will give me a chance to see you again in just
a few weeks, maybe only two, for its nearly October
now.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_12">[12]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Righto!&rdquo; was the cheerful reply. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s that
siren again. I must go. Will you come and say
good-bye to Dad?&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the other girl shook her head, her eyes brimming
with tears. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d rather not now. You tell
him for me. I&rsquo;m going home across lots. I don&rsquo;t
want anyone to see how near I am to crying.&rdquo; As
she spoke two tears splashed down her cheeks. Nann
caught her in a close embrace. &ldquo;Dear, dear sister-friend,&rdquo;
she said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to be just as lonely as
you are.&rdquo; Then, stooping, she picked an aster and
held it out, saying brightly, &ldquo;This golden aster
wants to go with you to tell you that we&rsquo;re going
to be as cheerful as we can, come what may. See
you next month, Dori, sure as sure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nann turned at the corner of the house to wave,
and then Dories walked slowly across lots thinking
over the conversation she had had with her dearly
loved friend. She paused a moment under the twin
elms where, in the long ago, they had vowed to be
loyal as any two sisters could be. Then, with a deep
sigh, she went on to the cosy brown house under
other spreading elms that she called home.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_13">[13]</div>
<h2 id="c2"><br />CHAPTER II.
<br />BANISHING GHOSTS</h2>
<p>There was a cheerful bustle in the kitchen when
Dories opened the side door. Her mother was preparing
the noon meal with her customary wordless
song, although now and then a merry message to
the frail boy, who so often sat in a low chair near the
stove, was sung to the melody. Just then the newcomer
heard the lilted announcement: &ldquo;Footsteps
I hear, and now will appear my very dear little
daughter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dories was repentant. &ldquo;Oh, Mother, if I haven&rsquo;t
stayed out too late again, and you&rsquo;ve had to stop
your sewing to get lunch.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Little Peter paused in his whittling long enough
to remark, &ldquo;Dori, you&rsquo;ve been crying. What for?&rdquo;</p>
<p>But a tactful mother shook her head quickly at the
small boy, saying brightly, &ldquo;O, I was glad to stop
sewing and stretch a bit. That brocade dress is hard
to work on. I don&rsquo;t know how many machine
needles it has broken. But since it belongs to a rich
person she won&rsquo;t mind paying for them.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_14">[14]</div>
<p>After putting the golden aster in a vase, Dories
snatched her apron from its hook in the closet and
put it on with darkening looks. &ldquo;Mother Moore,&rdquo;
she threatened, &ldquo;if you don&rsquo;t go and lie down on the
lounge until lunch is ready, I&rsquo;m not going to let you
sew a single bit more today. It&rsquo;s just terribly
wicked, and all wrong somehow, that you have to
make dresses for other women to keep us alive when
my very own father&rsquo;s very own Aunt Jane is simply
rolling in wealth, and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tut! Tut! Little firefly!&rdquo; Her mother laughingly
shook a stirring spoon in her direction. &ldquo;If you
had ever seen your stately old Aunt Jane, you just
couldn&rsquo;t conceive of her rolling in anything. That
would be much too undignified.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, Mother, you know I meant that figuratively,
not literally. She is rich and we are poor. Now
I ask you what right has one member of a family to
have all that his heart desires and another to have
to sew for a living.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Little Peter tittered: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s <i>her</i> heart, if it&rsquo;s Great-Aunt
Jane you&rsquo;re talking about.&rdquo; A sharp retort
was on the girl&rsquo;s lips when her mother said cheerily,
&ldquo;Now, kiddies, let&rsquo;s talk about something else. Mrs.
Doran sent us over a whole pint of cream. Shall we
have it whipped on those last blackberries that Peter
found this morning out in Briary Meadow, or shall
I make a little biscuit shortcake?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_15">[15]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Shortcake! Shortcake! I want shortcake!&rdquo;
Peter sang out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, Mother, you&rsquo;re too tired to make one,&rdquo;
Dories protested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you make it, Dori,&rdquo; Peter pleaded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know I couldn&rsquo;t make a biscuit shortcake,
Peter Moore, not if my life depended on it.&rdquo; The
girl was in a self-accusing mood. &ldquo;I never learned
how to do anything useful.&rdquo; Dories was putting the
pretty lunch dishes on a small table in the kitchen
corner breakfast-nook as she talked.</p>
<p>The understanding mother, realizing the conflicting
emotions that were making her young daughter
so unhappy, brought out the flour and other ingredients
as she said, &ldquo;Never too late to learn, dear.
Come and take your first lesson in biscuit-making.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Half an hour later, as they sat around the lunch
table, Dories told as much of her recent conversation
with her best friend as she wished to share. Then
they had the blackberry shortcake and real cream,
and even Peter acknowledged that it was &ldquo;most as
good as Mother&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_16">[16]</div>
<p>When the kitchen had been tidied and Peter had
gone to his little upper room for the nap that was so
necessary for the regaining of his health, Dories
went into the small sewing room which formerly
had been her father&rsquo;s den and stood looking discontentedly
out of the window. Her mother had
resumed sewing on the rich brocaded dress. When
the hum of the machine was stilled, she glanced
at the pensive girl and said: &ldquo;Dori dear, this is the
first afternoon that I can remember, almost, that
you have been at home with me. You and Nann
always went somewhere or did something. You are
going to miss your best friend ever so much, I know,
but&mdash;&rdquo; there was a break in the voice which caused
the girl to turn and look inquiringly at her mother,
who was intently pressing a seam, and who finished
her sentence a bit pathetically, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s going to mean a
good deal to me, daughter, to have your companionship
once in a while.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With a little cry the girl sprang across the room
and knelt at her mother&rsquo;s side, her arms about her.
&ldquo;O, Mumsie, was there ever a more selfish girl? I
don&rsquo;t see how you have kept on loving me all these
years.&rdquo; Then her pretty face flushed and she hesitated
before confessing: &ldquo;I hate to say it, for it
only shows how truly horrid I am, but I liked to be
over at Nann&rsquo;s, where the furniture was so beautiful,
not threadbare like ours.&rdquo; She was looking
through the open door into the living-room, where
she could see the old couch with its worn covering.
&ldquo;I ought to have stayed at home and helped you
with your sewing, but I will from now on.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_17">[17]</div>
<p>The mother, knowing that tears were near, put a
finger beneath the girl&rsquo;s chin and looked deep into
the repentant violet blue eyes. Kissing her tenderly,
she said merrily, &ldquo;Very well, young lady, if you
wish to punish yourself for past neglects, sit over
there in my low rocker and take the bastings out of
this skirt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dories obeyed and was soon busy at the simple
task. To change the subject, her mother spoke of
the planned trip. &ldquo;It will be your very first journey
away from Elmwood, dear. At your age I would
have been ever so excited.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl looked up from her work, a cloud of
doubt in her eyes. &ldquo;Oh, Mother, do you really think
that you would have been, if you were going to a
summer resort where the cottages were all shut up
tight as clams, boarded up, too, probably, and with
such a queer, grumphy person as Great-Aunt Jane
for company?&rdquo; The girl shuddered. &ldquo;Every time
I think of it I feel the chills run down my back. I
just know the place will be full of ghosts. I won&rsquo;t
sleep a wink all the time I&rsquo;m there. I&rsquo;m convinced
of that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her mother&rsquo;s merry laugh was reassuring.
&ldquo;Ghosts, dearie?&rdquo; she queried, glancing up. &ldquo;Surely
you aren&rsquo;t in earnest. You don&rsquo;t believe in ghosts,
do you?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_18">[18]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, maybe not, exactly, but there are the
queerest stories told about those lonely out-of-the-way
places. You know that there are, Mother. I
don&rsquo;t mean made-up stories in books. I mean real
newspaper accounts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But it doesn&rsquo;t matter what kind of paper they&rsquo;re
printed on, Dori,&rdquo; her mother put in, more seriously,
&ldquo;nothing could make a ghost story true. The only
ghosts that haunt us, really, are the memories of
loving words left unsaid and loving deeds that were
not done, and sometimes,&rdquo; she concluded sadly, &ldquo;it
is too late to ever banish those ghosts.&rdquo; Then, not
wishing to depress her already heart-broken daughter,
she said in a lighter tone, &ldquo;After all, why worry
about your visit to Siquaw Point, when, as yet, you
haven&rsquo;t heard that your Great-Aunt Jane has really
decided to go. I expected a letter every day last
week, but none came, so she may have given up the
plan for this year.&rdquo; Then, after glancing up at the
clock, she added, &ldquo;Three, and almost time for the
postman. I believe I hear his whistle now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At that moment Peter bounded in, his face rosy
from his nap. &ldquo;Postman&rsquo;s coming,&rdquo; he sang out.
&ldquo;Come on, Dori, I&rsquo;ll beat you to the gate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl rose, saying gloomily, &ldquo;This is probably
the fatal day. I&rsquo;m just sure there&rsquo;ll be a letter from
Great-Aunt Jane. I don&rsquo;t see why she chose me
when she&rsquo;s never even seen me.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_19">[19]</div>
<p>When Dories reached the front door, she saw that
Peter was already out in the road, frantically beckoning
to her. &ldquo;Hurry along, Dori. The postman&rsquo;s
just leaving Mrs. Doran&rsquo;s,&rdquo; he called; then as the
mail wagon, drawn by a lean white horse,
approached, the small boy ran out in the road and
waved his arms.</p>
<p>Mr. Higgins, who had stopped at their door ever
since Peter had been a baby, beamed at him over his
glasses. &ldquo;Law sakes!&rdquo; he exclaimed, &ldquo;Do I see a
bandit? Guess you&rsquo;ve been reading stories about
&lsquo;Dick Dead-shot&rsquo; holding up mail coaches in the
Rockies. Sorry, but there ain&rsquo;t nothin&rsquo; for you.&rdquo;
Then, smilingly, he addressed the girl. &ldquo;Likely in
a day or two I&rsquo;ll be fetchin&rsquo; you a letter, Dori, from
your old friend Nann Sibbett. It&rsquo;ll be powerfully
lonesome around here for you, I reckon, now she&rsquo;s
gone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl nodded. &ldquo;Just awfully lonesome, Mr.
Higgins, and please do bring me a letter soon.&rdquo;
Just then Johnnie Doran called for Peter to come
over and play, and the girl went slowly back to the
house.</p>
<p>Her mother looked up inquiringly. &ldquo;No letter at
all,&rdquo; Dories announced in so disappointed a tone that
she laughingly confessed, &ldquo;Mother, I do believe
that I&rsquo;m made up of the contrariest emotions. I do
hate the thought of spending that dismal month of
October with Great-Aunt Jane at Siquaw Point, but
I hate even worse going back to High without
Nann.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_20">[20]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Dear girl,&rdquo; the mother&rsquo;s voice held a tenderly
given rebuke, &ldquo;you aren&rsquo;t thinking in the least of the
pleasure your companionship might give your Great-Aunt
Jane. She was very fond of your father when
he was a boy, and he spent many a summer with her
at Siquaw. That may be her reason for inviting
you. Your father seemed to be the only person for
whom she really cared.&rdquo; Then, before the rather
surprised girl could reply, the mother continued, &ldquo;I
wish, dear, that you would hunt up your Aunt&rsquo;s last
letter and answer it more fully. I was so busy when
it came that I merely sent a few lines, thanking her
for the invitation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dories sighed as she rose to obey, but turned back
to listen when her mother continued: &ldquo;I know how
hard it is going to be, dear girl, but I have a reason,
which I cannot explain just now, for very much
wishing you to go. Now write the letter and make
it as interesting and newsy as you can.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dories, from the door, dropped a curtsy. &ldquo;Very
well, Mrs. Moore,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;to please you I&rsquo;ll write
to the crabbedy old lady, but&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; Her mother
merrily shook her finger at her. &ldquo;I want you to withhold
judgment, daughter, until you have seen your
Great-Aunt Jane.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_21">[21]</div>
<h2 id="c3"><br />CHAPTER III.
<br />A LOST MOTHER</h2>
<p>A week passed, and though Dories received
several picture postcards from her best friend, not
a line came from her Great-Aunt Jane.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She has probably changed her mind about going
to Siquaw, dear, and so you would better prepare to
start back to school on Monday. I had talked the
matter over with the principal, Mr. Setherly, and he
told me that you could easily make up October&rsquo;s
work, but, if you are not going away, it will be
better for you to begin the term with the others.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They were at breakfast, and for a long, silent
moment the girl sat gazing out of the window at a
garden that was beginning to look dry and sear.
When she turned back toward her mother, there
were tears in her eyes.</p>
<p>The woman placed a hand on the one near her as
she tenderly inquired, &ldquo;Are you disappointed because
you&rsquo;re not going, daughter?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_22">[22]</div>
<p>&ldquo;No, no, not that, but you can&rsquo;t know how I dread
returning to High without Nann. We had planned
graduating together and after that going to college
together if only we could find a way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her mother glanced up quickly as though there
was something that she wanted to say, then pressed
her lips firmly as though to keep some secret from
being uttered. Dories listlessly continued eating.
There was a closer pressure of her mother&rsquo;s hand.
&ldquo;It is hard, dear, I know,&rdquo; the understanding voice
was saying. &ldquo;Life brings many disappointments,
but there is always a compensation. You&rsquo;ll see!&rdquo;
Then, glancing toward the stair door, which was
slowly opening, the mother called, &ldquo;Hurry up, you
lazy Peterkins. Come and have your breakfast. I
want you and Dories to go to the village and match
some silk for me as soon as you can.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then, when she served the little fellow, the loving
woman returned to her daily task and left a half
self-pitying, half rebellious and wholly dispirited girl
to wash and put away the dishes. Then listlessly
she donned her scarlet tam and sweater coat and
went into the sewing room to get the samples that
she was to match. Her mother smiled up into her
dismal face. &ldquo;Dori, daughter, don&rsquo;t gloom around
so much,&rdquo; she pleaded. &ldquo;I shall actually believe that
you are disappointed because you are <i>not</i> going to
Siquaw. Now, here&rsquo;s the silk to be matched and
there&rsquo;s Peterkins waiting for you. Come back as
soon as you can, won&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_23">[23]</div>
<p>It was midmorning when Dories and the small
boy returned from the shopping expedition. They
went at once to the sewing room, but their mother
was not there. They looked in the living room and
in the kitchen. &ldquo;Mother, where are you?&rdquo; they both
called, but there was no reply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe she&rsquo;s upstairs,&rdquo; Peter suggested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course. How stupid for me to forget that
we have an upstairs to our house.&rdquo; Dories felt
strangely excited as she ran up the circling front
stairway calling again and again, but still there was
no reply. Down the long upper corridor they went,
opening one door and another, beginning to feel
almost frightened at the stillness.</p>
<p>Then Dories exclaimed, &ldquo;Oh, maybe she&rsquo;s gone
over to Mrs. Doran&rsquo;s for a moment. I guess she
couldn&rsquo;t do any sewing until we came back with the
silk.&rdquo; They were about to descend the back stairs
when they heard a noise in the garret overhead.</p>
<p>The frail boy caught his sister&rsquo;s hand and held
it tight. &ldquo;Do you suppose it&rsquo;s ghosts,&rdquo; he whispered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, of course not,&rdquo; the girl replied. The attic
was a low, dark, cobwebby place hardly high enough
to stand in, and they never went there. &ldquo;There are
no ghosts. Mother said so.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_24">[24]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Then maybe it&rsquo;s a rat scratching around,&rdquo; the
boy suggested, &ldquo;or that wild barn cat may have got
in somehow. Do you dare open the door, Dori, and
call up?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course I do, but first I&rsquo;ll creep up a little way
and look.&rdquo; Very quietly Dories opened the door and
stealthily ascended the dark, short stairway. All was
still in the dusky, musty attic. Then a light flashed
for a moment in a far corner. Truly frightened,
Dories turned and hurried down the stairs. Quick
steps were heard above: then a familiar voice called,
&ldquo;Dories, is that you, dear? Why are you stealing
about in that way? Come up a moment, daughter!
I want you to help me drag this old trunk out of
the corner.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then, when the girl, with Peter following, appeared
on the top step, the mother explained: &ldquo;I
thought I&rsquo;d be down before you could get back.
I have news for you, Dori. Just after you left, a
night letter was delivered. In it your Great-Aunt
Jane said that she had entirely given up her plan to
spend a month at Siquaw Point until she received
your letter. She had decided that if you were so
rude as to ignore her invitation, you were not the
kind of a girl she wished to know, even if you are
her niece, but your letter caused her to change her
mind. She wishes you to meet her this afternoon
in Boston and go directly from there to Siquaw
Point.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_25">[25]</div>
<p>&ldquo;O, Mother, how terrible!&rdquo; Dories was truly dismayed.
&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t have time to let Nann know, and
she was to meet me at the station. That was the one
redeeming feature about the whole thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you can see her when you return, and
maybe you can plan to stay a day or two with her.
Now help me with this little trunk, dear. We have
only two hours to prepare your clothes and pack.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They carried the small steamer trunk down to
Dories&rsquo; room and by noon it was packed and locked,
and, soon after, the expressman came to take both
the trunk and the girl to the station.</p>
<p>Dories&rsquo; face was flushed and tears were in her
eyes when she said good-bye. &ldquo;I feel so strange and
excited, Mother,&rdquo; she confided, &ldquo;going out into the
world for the very first time, and O, Mumsie, no one
knows how I dread being all alone in a boarded-up
cottage at a deserted summer resort with such a
dreadful old woman.&rdquo; Dories clung to her mother
in little girl fashion as though she hoped at the very
last moment she might be told that she need not go,
but what she heard was: &ldquo;Mr. Hanson is in a
hurry, dear. He has the trunk on his cart and he&rsquo;s
waiting to help you up on the seat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dories caught her breath in an effort not to cry,
kissed her mother and Peter hurriedly, picked up
her hand-satchel and darted down the path.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_26">[26]</div>
<p>From the high seat she waved and smiled. Then
she called in an effort at cheeriness. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t forget,
Mrs. Moore, that you promised to take October for
a real vacation and not sew a bit after you finish the
silk dress.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I promise!&rdquo; the mother called. &ldquo;Peter and I will
just play. Write to us often.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Hanson, finding that it was late, drove rapidly
to the station, and it was well that he did, for
the train was just drawing in when they arrived.
Dories quickly purchased a ticket and checked her
trunk with the expressman&rsquo;s help, then, climbing
aboard, chose a seat near a window. After all, she
found herself quite pleasurably excited. It was
such a new experience to be traveling alone. Few
of the passengers noticed her and no one spoke. She
was glad, as her mother had warned her not to enter
into conversation with strangers.</p>
<p>As she watched the flying landscape the girl
thought of something her mother had said on the
day that she had asked her to answer her Great-Aunt
Jane&rsquo;s letter. &ldquo;I have a reason, Dori, for really
wishing you to go to Siquaw with your aunt,&rdquo; she
had said. What could that reason be? Not until
Boston was neared did her speculation cease; then
she became conscious of but two emotions, curiosity
about her Great-Aunt Jane and a crushing disappointment
because she had not been able to let
Nann Sibbett know when to meet her.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_27">[27]</div>
<p>When the train finally stopped, Dories, feeling
very young and very much alone, followed the crowd
of passengers into the huge station. She was to
meet her aunt in the woman&rsquo;s waiting room, and
she stopped a hurrying porter to inquire where she
would find it. Almost timidly she entered the large,
comfortably furnished room, then, seeing an elderly
woman dressed in black, who was sitting stiffly erect,
the girl went toward her as she said diffidently:
&ldquo;Pardon me, but are <i>you</i> my Great-Aunt Jane?&rdquo;
The woman threw back a heavy black crepe veil and
her sharp gray eyes gazed up at the girl penetratingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Humph!&rdquo; was the ungracious reply. &ldquo;Well, at
least you&rsquo;ve got your father&rsquo;s eyes. That&rsquo;s something
to be thankful for, but I&rsquo;ve no doubt that you
look like your mother otherwise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was something about the tone in which this
was said that put the girl on the defensive.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I certainly hope I do look like my darling
mother,&rdquo; she exclaimed, her diffidence vanishing.
The elderly woman seemed not to hear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sit down, why don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; she said in a querulous
tone. &ldquo;The train doesn&rsquo;t go for an hour yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl sank into a comfortable chair which
faced the one occupied by her aunt; the back of
which was toward the door.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_28">[28]</div>
<p>For a moment neither spoke, then remembering
the coaching she had received, Dories said hesitatingly,
&ldquo;I want to thank you, Aunt Jane, for having
invited me to go with you. I am pleased to&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>A sniff preceded the remark that interrupted: &ldquo;I
know how pleased you are to go with a fussy old
woman to a deserted summer resort. About as
pleased as a cat is out in the rain.&rdquo; Then, as though
her interest in Dories had ceased, the old woman
drew the heavy cr&ecirc;pe veil down over her face, but
the girl was sure that she could see the sharp eyes
peering through it as though she were intently
watching some object over Dori&rsquo;s shoulder.</p>
<p>The girl had expected her aunt to be queer, but
this was far worse than her most dismal anticipations.
At last the girl became so nervous that she
glanced back of her to see what her aunt could be
watching. She saw only the open door that led into
the main waiting room of the station. Women were
passing in and out, but that was nothing to stare at.
Seeming, at last, to recall her companion&rsquo;s presence,
the old woman addressed her: &ldquo;Dories, you wrote
me that you had a girl friend here in Boston who
would come down to the train to see you off. Why
doesn&rsquo;t she come?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t have time to let her know, Aunt Jane,&rdquo;
was the dismal reply. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m just ever so disappointed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old woman nodded her head toward the door.
&ldquo;Is that her?&rdquo; she asked. &ldquo;Is that your friend?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_29">[29]</div>
<p>Dories sprang to her feet and turned. A tall girl,
carrying a suitcase, was approaching them. With a
cry of mingled amazement and joy, Dories ran
toward her and held out both hands. &ldquo;Why, Nann,
darling, it <i>can&rsquo;t</i> be you.&rdquo; The newcomer dropped
her bag and they flew into each other&rsquo;s arms. Then,
standing back, Dori asked, much mystified, &ldquo;Why,
are you going somewhere Nann?&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was the old woman who replied grimly: &ldquo;She
is! I invited her to go with us. There now! Don&rsquo;t
try to thank me.&rdquo; She held up a protesting hand
when Dori, flushed and happy, turned toward her.
&ldquo;I did it for myself, I can assure you. I knew having
you moping around for a month wouldn&rsquo;t add
any to <i>my</i> pleasure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>An embarrassing moment was saved by a stentorian
voice in the doorway announcing: &ldquo;All aboard
for Siquaw Center and way stations.&rdquo; A colored
porter appeared to carry the bags, and the old
woman, leaning heavily on her cane, limped after
him, followed by the girls, in whose hearts there
were mingled emotions, but joy predominated, for,
however terrible Dori&rsquo;s Great-Aunt Jane might be,
at least they were to spend a whole long month
together.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_30">[30]</div>
<h2 id="c4"><br />CHAPTER IV.
<br />SEAWARD BOUND</h2>
<p>There were very few people on the seaward-bound
train; indeed Miss Jane Moore, Nann and
Dories were the only occupants of the chair car.
After settling herself comfortably in the chair nearest
the front, the old woman, with a sweep of her
arm toward the back, said almost petulantly: &ldquo;Sit
as far away from me as you can. I may want to
sleep, and I know girls. They chatter, chatter, chatter,
titter, titter, titter all about nothing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her companions were glad to obey, and when
they were seated at the rear end of the car, they kept
their heads close together while they visited that they
might not disturb the elderly woman, who, to all
appearances, fell at once into a light doze.</p>
<p>As soon as the train was under way, Dories asked:
&ldquo;Now do tell me how this perfectly, unbelievably
wonderful thing has happened?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_31">[31]</div>
<p>Nann laughed happily. &ldquo;Maybe your Great-Aunt
Jane is a fairy godmother in disguise,&rdquo; she whispered.
They both glanced at the far corner, but the
black veiled figure was much more suggestive of a
witch than a good fairy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The disguise surely is a complete one,&rdquo; Dories
said with a shudder. &ldquo;My, it gives me the chilly
shivers when I think how I might be going to spend
a whole month alone with her. But now tell me,
just what did happen?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you guess? You wrote your aunt a letter,
didn&rsquo;t you, telling all about me and even giving the
name of the hotel where Dad and I were staying?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dories nodded, &ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s true. Mother wanted
me to write to Aunt Jane and I couldn&rsquo;t think of a
thing to tell her about, and so I wrote about you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; Nann continued to enlighten her friend,
&ldquo;she must have written me that very day inviting me
to be her guest at Siquaw Point for the month of
October, but she asked me not to let you know.
I sent the last picture postcard, the one of our hotel,
just after I had received her letter, and you can
imagine how wild I was to tell you. I hadn&rsquo;t started
going to the Boston High. Dear old Dad said a
month later wouldn&rsquo;t matter, and so here I am.&rdquo;
The girls clasped hands and beamed joyfully at each
other.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_32">[32]</div>
<p>Dories&rsquo; next glance toward the sleeping old
woman was one of gratitude. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to try hard
to love her, that is, if she&rsquo;ll let me.&rdquo; Then, after a
thoughtful moment, Dories continued: &ldquo;Great-Aunt
Jane must have been very different when Dad was a
boy, for he cared a lot for her, Mother said.&rdquo; Then
with one of her quick changes she exclaimed in a
low voice, &ldquo;Nann Sibbett, I have lain awake nights
dreading the dismal month I was to spend at that
forsaken summer resort. I just knew there&rsquo;d be
ghosts in those boarded-up cottages, but now that
you&rsquo;re going to be with me, I almost hope that something
exciting will happen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So do I!&rdquo; Nann agreed.</p>
<p>It was four o&rsquo;clock when the train, which consisted
of an engine, two coaches and a chair-car,
stopped in what seemed at first to be but wide
stretches of meadows and marsh lands, but, peering
ahead, the girls saw a few wooden buildings and a
platform. &ldquo;Siquaw Center!&rdquo; the brakeman opened
a door to announce. Miss Jane Moore sat up so
suddenly, and when she threw back her veil she
seemed so very wide awake, the girls found themselves
wondering if she had really been asleep at all.
The brakeman assisted the old woman to alight and
placed her bags on the platform, then, hardly pausing,
the train again was under way. Meadows and
marshes stretched in all directions, but about a mile
to the east the girls could see a wide expanse of
gray-blue ocean.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_33">[33]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I guess the name means the center of the
marshes,&rdquo; Dori whispered, making a wry face while
her aunt was talking to the station-master, a tall,
lank, red-whiskered man in blue overalls who did
not remove his cap nor stop chewing what seemed to
be a rather large quid.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yeah!&rdquo; the girls heard his reply to the woman&rsquo;s
question. &ldquo;Gib&rsquo;ll fetch the stage right over. Quare
time o&rsquo; year for yo&rsquo; to be comin&rsquo; out, Mis&rsquo; Moore,
ain&rsquo;t it? Yeah! I got your letter this here mornin&rsquo;.
The supplies ar&rsquo; all ready to tote over to yer
cottage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girls were wondering who Gib might be
when they heard a rumbling beyond the wooden
building and saw a very old stage coach drawn by
a rather boney old white horse and driven by a tall,
lank, red-headed boy. A small girl, with curls of
the same color, sat on the high seat at his side.
&ldquo;Hurry up, thar, you Gib Strait!&rdquo; the man, who was
recognizable as the boy&rsquo;s father, called to him.
&ldquo;Come tote Mis&rsquo; Moore&rsquo;s luggage.&rdquo; Then the man
sauntered off, having not even glanced in the direction
of the two girls, but the rather ungainly boy
who was hurrying toward them was looking at them
with but slightly concealed curiosity.</p>
<p>Miss Moore greeted him with, &ldquo;How do you do,
Gibralter Strait.&rdquo; Upon hearing this astonishing
name, the two girls found it hard not to laugh, but
the lad, evidently understanding, smiled broadly and
nodded awkwardly as Miss Moore solemnly proceeded
to introduce him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_34">[34]</div>
<p>To cover his embarrassment, the lad hastened to
say. &ldquo;Well, Miss Moore, sort o&rsquo; surprisin&rsquo; to see yo&rsquo;
hereabouts this time o&rsquo; year. Be yo&rsquo; goin&rsquo; to the
Pint?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old woman looked at him scathingly. &ldquo;Well,
Gibralter, where in heaven&rsquo;s name would I be going?
I&rsquo;m not crazy enough yet to stay long in the Center.
Here, you take my bags; the girls can carry their
own.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yessum, Miss Moore,&rdquo; the boy flushed up to the
roots of his red hair. He knew that he wasn&rsquo;t making
a very good impression on the young ladies. He
glanced at them furtively as they all walked toward
the stage; then, when he saw them smiling toward
him, not critically but in a most friendly fashion,
there was merry response in his warm red-brown
eyes. What he said was: &ldquo;If them bags are too
hefty, set &rsquo;em down an&rsquo; I&rsquo;ll come back for &rsquo;em.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O, we can carry them easily,&rdquo; Nann assured him.</p>
<p>The small girl on the high seat was staring down
at them with eyes and mouth open. She had on a
nondescript dress which very evidently had been
made over from a garment meant for someone older.
When the girls glanced up, she smiled down at them,
showing an open space where two front teeth were
missing.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_35">[35]</div>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s your name, little one?&rdquo; Nann called up
to her. The lad was inside the coach helping Miss
Moore to settle among her bags.</p>
<p>The child&rsquo;s grin grew wilder, but she did not
reply. Nann turned toward her brother, who was
just emerging: &ldquo;What is your little sister&rsquo;s name?&rdquo;
she asked.</p>
<p>The boy flushed. Nann and Dori decided that he
was easily embarrassed or that he was unused to
girls of his own age. But they better understood
the flush when they heard the answer: &ldquo;Her name&rsquo;s
Behring.&rdquo; Then he hurried on to explain: &ldquo;I know
our names are queer. It was Pa&rsquo;s notion to give us
geography names, being as our last is Strait. That&rsquo;s
why mine&rsquo;s Gibralter. Yo&rsquo; kin laugh if yo&rsquo; want
to,&rdquo; he added good-naturedly. &ldquo;I would if &rsquo;twasn&rsquo;t
my name.&rdquo; Then in a low voice, with a swift glance
toward the station, he confided, &ldquo;I mean to change
my name when I come of age. I sure sartin do.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_36">[36]</div>
<p>The girls felt at once that they would like this boy
whose sensitive face expressed his every emotion and
who had so evident a sense of humor. They were
about to climb inside of the coach with Miss Moore
when a shrill, querulous voice from a general store
across from the station attracted their attention. A
tall, angular woman in a skimp calico dress stood
there. &ldquo;Howdy, Miss Moore,&rdquo; she called, then as
though not expecting a reply to her salutation, she
continued: &ldquo;Behring Strait, you come here right
this minute and mind the baby. What yo&rsquo; gallavantin&rsquo;
off fer, and me with the supper gettin&rsquo; to
do?&rdquo; Nann and Dori glanced at each other merrily,
each wondering which strait the baby was named
after.</p>
<p>The small girl obeyed quickly. Mrs. Strait impressed
the listeners as a woman who demanded instant
obedience. As soon as the three passengers
were settled inside, the coach started with a lurch.
The sandy road wound through the wide, swampy
meadows. It was rough and rutty. Miss Moore sat
with closed eyes and, as she was wedged in between
two heavy bags, she was not jounced about as much
as were the girls. They took it good-naturedly, but
Dories found it hard to imagine how she could have
endured the journey if she had been alone with her
queer Aunt Jane. Nann decided that the old woman
feined sleep on all occasions to avoid the necessity
of talking to them.</p>
<p>At last, even above the rattle of the old coach,
could be heard the crashing surf on rocks, and the
girls peered eagerly ahead. What they saw was a
wide strip of sand and a row of weather-beaten cottages,
boarded up, as Dori had prophesied, and beyond
them white-crested, huge gray breakers rushing
and roaring up on the sand.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_37">[37]</div>
<p>The boney white horse came to a sudden stop at
the edge of the beach, nor would it attempt to go
any farther. The boy leaped over a wheel and threw
open the back door. &ldquo;Guess you&rsquo;ll have to walk a
piece along the beach, Miss Moore. The coach gets
stuck so often in the sand ol&rsquo; Methuselah ain&rsquo;t takin&rsquo;
no chances at tryin&rsquo; to haul it out,&rdquo; he informed the
occupants.</p>
<p>The girls were almost surprised to find that the
horse hadn&rsquo;t been named after a strait. Miss Moore
threw back her veil and opened her eyes at once.
Upon hearing what the boy had to say, she leaned
forward to gaze at the largest cottage in the middle
of the row. She spoke sharply: &ldquo;Gibralter, why
didn&rsquo;t your father carry out my orders? I wrote
him distinctly to open up the cottage and air it out.
Why didn&rsquo;t he do that when he brought over the
supplies, that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;d like to know? I declare to
it, even if he is your father, I must say Simon Strait
is a most shiftless man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boy said at once, as though in an effort to
apologize: &ldquo;Pa&rsquo;s been real sick all summer, Miss
Moore, and like &rsquo;twas he fergot it, but I kin open
up easy, if I kin find suthin&rsquo; to pry off the boards
with. I think likely I&rsquo;ll find an axe, anyhow, out in
the back shed whar I used to chop wood fer you.
I&rsquo;m most sure I will.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_38">[38]</div>
<p>Miss Moore sank back. &ldquo;Well, hurry up about it,
then. I&rsquo;ll stay in the coach till you get the windows
uncovered.&rdquo; When the boy was gone, the woman
turned toward her niece. &ldquo;Open up that small
black bag, Dories; the one near you, and get out the
back-door key. There&rsquo;s a hammer just inside on the
kitchen table, if it&rsquo;s where I left it.&rdquo; She continued
her directions: &ldquo;Give it to Gibralter and tell him,
when he gets the boards off the windows, to carry
in some wood and make a fire. A fog is coming in
this minute and it&rsquo;s as wet as rain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The key having been found, the girls ran gleefully
around the cabin in search of the boy. They
found him emerging from a shed carrying a hatchet.
He grinned at them as though they were old friends.
&ldquo;Some cheerful place, this!&rdquo; he commented as he
began ripping off the boards from one of the kitchen
windows. &ldquo;You girls must o&rsquo; needed sea air a lot
to come to this place out o&rsquo; season like this with
a&mdash;a&mdash;wall, with a old lady like Miss Moore is.&rdquo;
Dories felt sure that the boy was thinking something
quite different, but was not saying it because
it was a relative of hers about whom he was talking.
What she replied was: &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t understand it myself.
I mean why Great-Aunt Jane wanted to come
to this dismal place after everyone else has gone.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_39">[39]</div>
<p>They were up on the back porch and, as she looked
out across the swampy meadows over which a heavy
fog was settling, then she continued, more to Nann
than to the boy: &ldquo;I promised Mother I wouldn&rsquo;t be
afraid of ghosts, but honestly I never saw a spookier
place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boy had been making so much noise ripping
off boards that he had only heard the last two words.
&ldquo;Spooks war yo&rsquo; speakin&rsquo; of?&rdquo; he inquired. &ldquo;Well,
I guess yo&rsquo;ll think thar&rsquo;s spooks enough along about
the middle of the night when the fog horn&rsquo;s a moanin&rsquo;
an&rsquo; the surf&rsquo;s a crashin&rsquo; out on the pint o&rsquo; rocks,
an&rsquo; what&rsquo;s more, thar <i>is</i> folks at Siquaw Center as
says thar&rsquo;s a sure enough spook livin&rsquo; over in the
ruins that used to be ol&rsquo; Colonel Wadbury&rsquo;s place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girls shuddered and Dories cast a &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t I
tell you so&rdquo; glance at her friend, but Nann, less fearful
by nature, was interested and curious, and after
looking about in vain for the &ldquo;ruin&rdquo;, she inquired
its whereabouts.</p>
<p>Gibralter enlightened them. &ldquo;O, &rsquo;tisn&rsquo;t in sight,&rdquo;
he said, &ldquo;that is, not from here. It&rsquo;s over beyant
the rocky pint. From the highest rock thar you kin
see it plain.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_40">[40]</div>
<p>Then as he went on around the cottage taking off
boards, the girls followed to hear more of the interesting
subject. &ldquo;Fine house it used to be when my
Pa was a kid, but now thar&rsquo;s nothing but stone walls
a standin&rsquo;. A human bein&rsquo; couldn&rsquo;t live in that ol&rsquo;
shell, nohow. But&mdash;&rdquo; the boy could not resist the
temptation to elaborate the theme when he saw
the wide eyes of his listeners, &ldquo;&rsquo;long about midnight
folks at the Center do say as how they&rsquo;ve seen a light
movin&rsquo; about in the old ruin. Nobody&rsquo;s dared to go
near &rsquo;nuf to find out what &rsquo;tis. The swamps all
about are like quicksand. If you step in &rsquo;em, wall,
golly gee, it&rsquo;s good-bye fer yo&rsquo;. Leastwise that&rsquo;s
what ol&rsquo;-timers say, an&rsquo; so the spook, if thar is one
over thar, is safe &rsquo;nuf from introosion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While the boy had been talking, he had removed
all of the wooden blinds, his listeners having followed
him about the cabin. Dories had been so
interested that she had quite forgotten about the
huge key that she had been carrying. &ldquo;O my!&rdquo; she
exclaimed, suddenly noticing it. &ldquo;But then you
didn&rsquo;t need the hammer after all. Now I&rsquo;ll skip
around and open the back door, and, Gibralter, will
you bring in some wood, Aunt Jane said, to build
us a fire?&rdquo;</p>
<p>While the boy was gone, Nann confided merrily,
&ldquo;There now, Dories Moore, you&rsquo;ve been wishing for
an adventure, and here is one all ready made and
waiting. Pray, what could be more thrilling than
an old ruin surrounded by an uncrossable swamp and
a mysterious light which appears at midnight?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_41">[41]</div>
<p>The boy returned with an armful of logs left over
from the supply of a previous summer. &ldquo;Gib,&rdquo; Nann
addressed him in her friendliest fashion, &ldquo;may we
call you that? Gibralter is <i>so</i> long. I&rsquo;d like to visit
your ruin and inspect the ghost in his lair. Really
and truly, isn&rsquo;t there any way to reach the place?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boy looked as though he had a secret which
he did not care to reveal. &ldquo;Well, maybe there is,
and maybe there isn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; he said uncommittedly.
Then, with a brightening expression in his red-brown
eyes, &ldquo;Anyway, I&rsquo;ll show you the old ruin if
yo&rsquo;ll meet me at sun-up tomorrow mornin&rsquo; out at
the pint o&rsquo; rocks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m game,&rdquo; Nann said gleefully. &ldquo;It sounds interesting
to me all right. How about you, Dori?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O, I&rsquo;m quite willing to see the place from a distance,&rdquo;
the other replied, &ldquo;but nothing could induce
me to go very near it.&rdquo; Neither of the girls thought
of asking the advice of their elderly hostess, who, at
that very moment, appeared around a corner of the
cabin to inquire why it was taking such an endless
time to open up the cottage. Luckily Gib had started
a fire in the kitchen stove, which partly mollified the
woman&rsquo;s wrath. After bringing in the bags and
supplies, the boy took his departure, and they could
hear him whistling as he drove away through
the fog.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_42">[42]</div>
<h2 id="c5"><br />CHAPTER V.
<br />A NEW EXPERIENCE</h2>
<p>With the closing in of the fog, twilight settled
about the cabin. The old woman, still in her black
bonnet with the veil thrown back, drew a wooden
armed chair close to the stove and held her hands
out toward the warmth. &ldquo;Open up the box of supplies,
Dories,&rdquo; she commanded, &ldquo;and get out some
candles. Then you can fill a hot-water bottle for
me and I&rsquo;ll go right to bed. No use making a fire
in the front room until tomorrow. You girls are to
sleep upstairs. You&rsquo;ll find bedding in a bureau up
there. It may be damp, but you&rsquo;re young. It won&rsquo;t
hurt you any.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dories, having opened up the box of supplies, removed
each article, placing it on the table. At the
very bottom she found a note scribbled on a piece of
wrapping paper: &ldquo;Out of candles. Send some
tomorrer.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_43">[43]</div>
<p>Miss Moore sat up ramrod-straight, her sharp
gray eyes narrowing angrily. &ldquo;If that isn&rsquo;t just like
that shiftless, good-for-nothing Simon Strait. How
did he suppose we could get on without light? I
wish now I had ordered kerosene, but I thought,
just at first, that candles would do.&rdquo; In the dusk
Nann had been looking about the kitchen. On a
shelf she saw a lantern and two glass lamps. &ldquo;O,
Miss Moore!&rdquo; she exclaimed, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think
maybe there might be oil in one of those lamps?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; the old woman replied. &ldquo;I always
had my maid empty them the last thing for fear of
fire.&rdquo; Nann, standing on a chair, had taken down
the lantern. Her face brightened. &ldquo;I hear a swish,&rdquo;
she said hopefully, &ldquo;and so it must be oil.&rdquo; With a
piece of wrapping paper she wiped off the dust while
Dories brought forth a box of matches.</p>
<p>A dim, sputtering light rewarded them. &ldquo;It won&rsquo;t
last long,&rdquo; Nann said as she placed the lantern on
the table, &ldquo;So, Miss Moore, if you&rsquo;ll tell us what to
do to make you comfortable, we&rsquo;ll hurry around
and do it.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_44">[44]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Comfortable? Humph! We won&rsquo;t any of us
be very comfortable with such a wet fog penetrating
even into our bones.&rdquo; The old woman complained
so bitterly that Dories found herself wondering why
her Great-Aunt Jane had come at all if she had
known that she would be uncomfortable. But she
had no time to give the matter further thought, for
Miss Moore was issuing orders. &ldquo;Dories, you work
that pump-handle over there in the sink. If it needs
priming, we won&rsquo;t get any water tonight. Well,
thank goodness, it doesn&rsquo;t. That&rsquo;s one thing that
went right. Nann, you rinse out the tea kettle, fill
it and set it to boil. Now you girls take the lantern
and go to my bedroom. It&rsquo;s just off the big front
room, so you can&rsquo;t miss it; open up the bottom
bureau drawer and fetch out my bedding. We&rsquo;ll
hang it over chairs by the stove till the damp gets
out of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nann took the sputtering lantern and, being the
fearless one of the two, she led the way into the big
front room of the cabin. The furniture could not
be seen for the sheetlike coverings. In the dim light
the girls could see a few pictures turned face to the
wall. &ldquo;Oh-oo!&rdquo; Dories shuddered. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s clammily
damp in here. Think of it, Nann, can you conceive
<i>what</i> it would have been like for <i>me</i> if I had come
all alone with Aunt Jane? Well, I know just as well
as I know anything that I would never have lived
through this first night.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_45">[45]</div>
<p>Nann laughed merrily. &ldquo;O, Dori,&rdquo; she exclaimed
as she held the lantern up, &ldquo;Do look at this wonderful,
huge stone fireplace. I&rsquo;m sure we&rsquo;re going to
enjoy it here when we get things straightened around
and the sun is shining. You see if we don&rsquo;t.&rdquo; Nann
was opening a door which she believed must lead
into Miss Moore&rsquo;s bedroom, and she was right. The
dim, flickering light revealed an old-fashioned hand-turned
bed with four high posts. Near was an
antique bureau, and Dori quickly opened the bottom
drawer and took out the needed bedding. With her
arms piled high, she followed the lantern-bearer back
to the kitchen. Miss Moore had evidently not moved
from her chair by the stove. &ldquo;Put on another piece
of wood, Dori,&rdquo; she commanded. &ldquo;Now fetch all
the chairs up and spread the bedding on it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When this had been done, the teakettle was singing,
and Nann said brightly, &ldquo;What a little optimist
a teakettle is! It sings even when things are
darkest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean when things are hottest,&rdquo; Dori put in,
actually laughing.</p>
<p>The old woman was still giving orders. &ldquo;The
dishes are in that cupboard over the table,&rdquo; she nodded
in that direction. &ldquo;Fetch out a cup and saucer,
Dories, wash them with some hot water and make
me a cup of tea. Then, while I drink it, you can
both spread up my bed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Fifteen minutes later all these things had been
accomplished. The old woman acknowledged that
she was as comfortable as possible in her warm bed.
When they had said good-night, she called, &ldquo;Dories,
I forgot to tell you the stairway to your room leads
up from the back porch.&rdquo; Then she added, as an
afterthought, &ldquo;You girls will want to eat something,
but for mercy sake, do close the living-room door
so I won&rsquo;t hear your clatter.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_46">[46]</div>
<p>Nann, whose enjoyment of the situation was real
and not feined, placed the sputtering lantern on the
kitchen table while Dories softly closed the door as
she had been directed. Then they stood and gazed
at the supplies still in boxes and bundles on the
oilcloth-covered table. &ldquo;I never was hungrier!&rdquo;
Dories announced. &ldquo;But there isn&rsquo;t time to really
cook anything before the light will go out. Oh-oo!
Think how terrible it would be to have to climb up
that cold, wet outside stairway to a room in the loft
and get into cold, wet bedding, and all in the dark.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nann laughed. &ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ll confess it <i>is</i> rather
spooky,&rdquo; she agreed, &ldquo;and if I believed in ghosts
I might be scared.&rdquo; Then, as the lantern gave a
warning flicker, the older girl suggested: &ldquo;What
say to turning out the light and make more fire in
the stove? It really is quite bright over in that
corner.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess it&rsquo;s the only thing to do,&rdquo; Dori acknowledged
dolefully. &ldquo;O goodie,&rdquo; she added more cheerfully
as she held up a box of crackers. &ldquo;These, with
butter and some sardines, <i>ought</i> to keep us from
starving.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_47">[47]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Great!&rdquo; Nann seemed determined to be appreciative.
&ldquo;And for a drink let&rsquo;s have cambric tea
with canned milk and sugar. Now the next thing,
where is a can opener?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She opened a drawer in the kitchen table and
squealed exultingly, &ldquo;Dories Moore, see what I&rsquo;ve
found.&rdquo; She was holding something up. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a
little candle end, but it will be just the thing if we
need a light in the night when our oil is gone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Goodness!&rdquo; Dories shuddered. &ldquo;I hope we&rsquo;ll
sleep so tight we won&rsquo;t know it is night until after
it&rsquo;s over.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nann had also found a can opener and they were
soon hungrily eating the supper Dories had suggested.
&ldquo;I call this a great lark!&rdquo; the older girl said
brightly. They were sitting on straight wooden
chairs, drawn close to the bright fire, and their
viands were on another chair between them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The kitchen is so nice and warm now that I hate
plunging out into the fog to go upstairs,&rdquo; Dori shudderingly
remarked. &ldquo;I presume that is where Aunt
Jane&rsquo;s maid used to sleep. Mumsie said she had one
named Maggie who had been with her forever,
almost. But she died last June. That must be why
Aunt Jane didn&rsquo;t come here this summer.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_48">[48]</div>
<p>When the girls had eaten all of the sardines and
crackers and had been refreshed with cambric tea,
they rose and looked at each other almost tragically.
Then Nann smiled. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t let&rsquo;s give ourselves time
to think,&rdquo; she suggested. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s take a box of
matches. You get one while I relight the lantern.
I have the candle end in my pocket. Now, bolster
up your courage and open the door while I shelter
our flickering flame from the cold night air that
might blow it out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dories had her hand on the knob of the door
which led out upon the back porch, but before opening
it, she whispered, &ldquo;Nann, you don&rsquo;t suppose that
ghost over in the ruin ever prowls around anywhere
else, do you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course not, silly!&rdquo; Nann&rsquo;s tone was reassuring.
&ldquo;There isn&rsquo;t a ghost in the old ruin, or anywhere
else for that matter. Now open the door and
let&rsquo;s ascend to our chamber.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The fog on the back porch was so dense that it
was difficult for the girls to find the entrance to their
boarded-in stairway. As they started the ascent,
Nann in the lead, they were both wondering what
they would find when they reached their loft bedroom.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_49">[49]</div>
<h2 id="c6"><br />CHAPTER VI.
<br />A LIGHT IN THE DARK</h2>
<p>The girls cautiously crept up the back stairway
which was sheltered from fog and wind only by
rough boards between which were often wide cracks.
Time and again a puff of air threatened to put out
the flickering flame in the lantern. With one hand
Nann guarded it, lest it suddenly sputter out and
leave them in darkness. There was a closed door
at the top of the stairs, and of course, it was locked,
but the key was in it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t that seem sort of queer?&rdquo; Dories asked
as her friend unlocked the door, removed the key
and placed it on the inside.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it does, sort of,&rdquo; Nann had to acknowledge,
&ldquo;but I&rsquo;m mighty glad it was there, or how else
could we have entered?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dories said nothing, but, deep in her heart, she
was wishing that she and Nann were safely back in
Elmwood, where there were electric lights and other
comforts of civilization.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_50">[50]</div>
<p>Holding the lantern high, the girls stood in the
middle of the loft room and looked around. It was
unfinished after the fashion of attics, and though
it was quite high at the peak, the sloping roof made
a tent-like effect. There were two windows. One
opened out toward the rocky point, above which a
continuous inward rush of white breakers could be
seen, and the other, at the opposite side, opened
toward swampy meadows, a mile across which on
clear nights could be seen the lights of Siquaw
Center.</p>
<p>A big, old-fashioned high posted bed, an equally
old-fashioned mahogany bureau and two chairs were
all of the furnishings.</p>
<p>They found bedding in the bureau drawers, as
Miss Moore had told them. Placing the lantern on
the bureau, Nann said: &ldquo;If we wish to have light
on the subject, we&rsquo;d better make the bed in a hurry.
You take that side and I&rsquo;ll take this, and we&rsquo;ll have
these quilts spread in a twinkling.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dories did as she was told and the bed was soon
ready for occupancy. Then the girls scrambled out
of their dresses, and, just as they leaped in between
the quilts, the flame in the lantern sputtered and
went out.</p>
<p>Dories clutched her friend fearfully. &ldquo;Oh, Nann,&rdquo;
she said, &ldquo;we never looked under the bed nor behind
that curtained-off corner. I don&rsquo;t dare go to sleep
unless I know what&rsquo;s there.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_51">[51]</div>
<p>Her companion laughed. &ldquo;What do you &rsquo;spose
is there?&rdquo; she inquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How can I tell?&rdquo; Dories retorted. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s why
I wish we had looked and then I would know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her friend&rsquo;s voice, merry even in the darkness,
was reassuring. &ldquo;I can tell you just as well as if
I had looked,&rdquo; she announced with confidence. &ldquo;Back
of these curtains, you would find nothing but a row
of nails or hooks on which to hang our garments
when we unpack our suitcases, and under the bed
there is only dust in little rolled-up heaps&mdash;like as
not. Now, dear, let&rsquo;s see who can go to sleep first, for
you know we have an engagement with our friend,
Gibralter Strait, at sunrise tomorrow morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You say that as though you were pleased with
the prospect,&rdquo; Dories complained.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pleased fails to express the joy with which I
anticipate the&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; Nann said no more, for Dories
had clutched her, whispering excitedly, &ldquo;Hark!
What was that noise? It sounds far off, maybe
where the haunted ruin is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nann listened and then calmly replied: &ldquo;More
than likely it&rsquo;s the fog horn about which Gib told us,
and that other noise is the muffled roar of the surf
crashing over the rocks out on the point. If there
are any more noises that you wish me to explain,
please produce them now. If not, I&rsquo;m going to
sleep.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_52">[52]</div>
<p>After that Dories lay very still for a time, confident
that she wouldn&rsquo;t sleep a wink. Nann, however,
was soon deep in slumber and Dories soon followed
her example. It was midnight when she
awakened with a start, sat up and looked about her.
She felt sure that a light had awakened her. At first
she couldn&rsquo;t recall where she was. She turned toward
the window. The fog had lifted and the night was
clear. For a moment she sat watching the white,
rushing line of the surf, then, farther along, she saw
a dark looming object.</p>
<p>Suddenly she clutched her companion. &ldquo;Nann,&rdquo;
she whispered dramatically, &ldquo;there it is! There&rsquo;s a
light moving over by the point. Do you suppose
that&rsquo;s the ghost from the old ruin?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The what?&rdquo; Nann sat up, dazed from being so
suddenly awakened. Then, when Dories repeated
her remark, her companion gazed out of the window
toward the point.</p>
<p>&ldquo;H&rsquo;m-m!&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a light all right. A lantern,
I should say, and its moving slowly along as
though it were being carried by someone who is
searching for something among the rocks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dori&rsquo;s hold on her friend&rsquo;s arm became tighter.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s coming this way! I&rsquo;m just ever so sure that
it is. Oh, Nann, why did we come to this dreadful
place? What if that light came right up to this cottage
and saw that it wasn&rsquo;t boarded up and knew
someone was here and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_53">[53]</div>
<p>Nann chuckled. &ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you getting rather mixed
in your figures of speech?&rdquo; she teased. &ldquo;A lantern
can&rsquo;t see or know, but of course I understand that
you mean the-well-er-person carrying the lantern.
I suppose you will agree that it is a person, for
ghosts don&rsquo;t have to carry lanterns, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you know so much about ghosts, since
you say there are no such things?&rdquo; Dori flared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, nothing can&rsquo;t carry a lantern, can it?&rdquo; was
the unruffled reply. Then the two girls were silent,
watching the light which seemed now and then to
be held high as though whoever carried it paused at
times to look about him and then continued to search
on the rocks.</p>
<p>Slowly, slowly the light approached the row of
boarded-up cabins. The girls crept from bed and
knelt at the window on the seaward side. Nann,
because she was interested, and Dori because she did
not want to be left alone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think it&rsquo;s coming this far?&rdquo; came the
anxious whisper. Nann shook her head. &ldquo;No,&rdquo; she
said, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s going back toward the point and so I&rsquo;m
going back to bed. I&rsquo;m chilled through as it is.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_54">[54]</div>
<p>They were soon under the covers and when they
again glanced toward the window the light had disappeared.
&ldquo;Seems to have been swallowed up,&rdquo;
Nann remarked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe it&rsquo;s fallen over the cliff. I almost hope
that it has, and been swept out to sea.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Meaning the lantern, I suppose, or do you mean
the carrier thereof?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nann Sibbett, I don&rsquo;t see how you can help being
just as afraid of whatever it is, or, rather of whoever
it is, as I am.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because I am convinced that since it, or he,
doesn&rsquo;t know of my existence, I am not the object
of the search, so why should I be afraid? Now, Miss
Dories Moore, if you wish to stay awake speculating
as to what became of that light, you may, but I&rsquo;m
going to sleep, and, if this loft bedroom of ours is
just swarming with ghosts and mysterious lights,
don&rsquo;t you waken me to look at them until morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So saying, Nann curled up and went to sleep.
Dories, fearing that she would again be awakened
by a light, drew the quilt up over her head so that
she could not see it.</p>
<p>Although she was nearly smothered, like an
ostrich, she felt safer, and in time she too slept, but
she dreamed of headless horsemen and hollow-eyed
skeletons that walked out on the rocky point at midnight
carrying lanterns.</p>
<p>It was nearing dawn when a low whistle outside
awakened the girls.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_55">[55]</div>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s Gibralter Strait, I do believe,&rdquo; Nann declared,
at once alert. Then, as she sprang up, she
whispered, &ldquo;Do hurry, Dori. I feel ever so sure
that we are this day starting on a thrilling adventure.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_56">[56]</div>
<h2 id="c7"><br />CHAPTER VII.
<br />THE PHANTOM YACHT</h2>
<p>The girls dressed hurriedly and silently, then
crept down the boarded-in stairway and emerged
upon the back porch of the cottage. It was not yet
dawn, but a rosy glow in the east assured them that
the day was near.</p>
<p>The waiting lad knew that the girls had something
to tell, nor was he wrong.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Gibralter, what do you think?&rdquo; Dories began
at once in an excited whisper that they might not
disturb Great-Aunt Jane, who, without doubt, was
still asleep.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I dunno. What?&rdquo; the boy was frankly curious.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We saw it last night. We saw it with our very
own eyes! Didn&rsquo;t we, Nann?&rdquo; The other maiden
agreed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You saw what?&rdquo; asked the mystified boy, looking
from one to the other. Then, comprehendingly, he
added: &ldquo;Gee, you don&rsquo; mean as you saw the spook
from the old ruin, do you?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_57">[57]</div>
<p>Dories nodded, but Nann modified: &ldquo;Not that,
Gibralter. Since there is no such thing as a ghost,
how could we see it? But we did see the light you
were telling about. Someone was walking along the
rocks out on the point carrying a lighted lantern.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wall,&rdquo; the boy announced triumphantly, &ldquo;that
proves &rsquo;twas a spook, &rsquo;cause human beings couldn&rsquo;t
get a foothold out there, the rocks are so jagged
and irregular like. But come along, maybe we can
find footprints or suthin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The sun was just rising out of the sea when the
three young people stole back of the boarded-up cottages
that stood in a silent row, and emerged upon
the wide stretch of sandy beach that led toward the
point.</p>
<p>The tide was low and the waves small and far out.
The wet sand glistened with myriad colors as the
sun rose higher. The air was tinglingly cold and,
once out of hearing of the aunt, the girls, no longer
fearful, ran along on the hard sand, laughing and
shouting joyfully, while the boy, to express the
exuberance of his feelings, occasionally turned a
hand-spring just ahead of them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, what a wonderful morning!&rdquo; Nann exclaimed,
throwing out her arms toward the sea and
taking a deep breath. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s good just to be alive.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dories agreed. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s hard to believe in ghosts on
a day like this,&rdquo; she declared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then why try?&rdquo; Nan merrily questioned.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_58">[58]</div>
<p>They had reached the high headland of jagged
rocks that stretched out into the sea, and Gibralter,
bounding ahead, climbed from one rock to another,
sure-footed as a goat but the girls remained on the
sand.</p>
<p>When he turned, they called up to him: &ldquo;Do you
see anything suspicious looking?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nixy!&rdquo; was the boy&rsquo;s reply. Then anxiously:
&ldquo;D&rsquo;ye think yo&rsquo; girls can climb on the tip-top rock?&rdquo;
Then, noting Dories&rsquo; anxious expression as she
viewed the jagged cliff-like mass ahead of her, he
concluded with. &ldquo;O, course yo&rsquo; can&rsquo;t. Hold on, I&rsquo;ll
give yo&rsquo; a hand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Very carefully the boy selected crevices that made
stairs on which to climb, and the girls, delighted
with the adventure, soon arrived on the highest rock,
which they were glad to find was so huge and flat
that they could all stand there without fear of
falling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is a dizzy height,&rdquo; Dories said, looking
down at the waves that were lazily breaking on the
lowest rocks. &ldquo;But there&rsquo;s one thing that puzzles me
and makes me think more than ever that what we
saw last night was a ghost.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; Nann put in. &ldquo;I believe I am thinking
the same thing. <i>How</i> could a man walk back and
forth on these jagged rocks carrying a lantern?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_59">[59]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Huh,&rdquo; their companion remarked, &ldquo;Spooks kin
walk anywhar&rsquo;s they choose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, Gibralter Strait, I do believe that you think
there is a ghost in&mdash;&rdquo; She paused and turned to
look in the direction that the boy was pointing. On
the other side of the point, below them, was a swamp,
dense with high rattling tullies and cat-tails. It
looked dark and treacherous, for, as yet, the sunlight
had not reached it. About two hundred feet back
from the sea stood the forlorn ruin of what had
once been, apparently, a fine stone mansion.</p>
<p>Two stained white pillars, standing in front, were
like ghostly sentinels telling where the spacious
porch had been. Behind them were jagged heaps of
crumbling rock, all that remained of the front and
side walls. The wall in the rear was still standing,
and from it the roof, having lost its support in front,
pitched forward with great yawning gaps in it, where
chimneys had been.</p>
<p>Dories unconsciously clung to her friend as they
stood gazing down at the old ruin. &ldquo;Poor, poor
thing,&rdquo; Nann said, &ldquo;how sad and lonely it must be,
for, I suppose, once upon a time it was very fine
home filled with love and happiness. Wasn&rsquo;t it,
Gibralter? If you know the story of the old house,
please tell it to us?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_60">[60]</div>
<p>The boy cast a quick glance at the timid Dories.
&ldquo;I dunno as I&rsquo;d ought to. She scares so easy,&rdquo; he
told them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll promise not to scare this time,&rdquo; Dories hastened
to say. &ldquo;Honest, Gib, I am as eager to hear
the story as Nann is, so please tell it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thus urged, the boy began. He did not speak,
however, in his usual merry, bantering voice, but in
a hollow whisper which he believed better fitted to
the tale he had to tell.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wall,&rdquo; he said, as he seated himself on a rock,
motioning the girls to do likewise, &ldquo;I might as well
start way back at the beginnin&rsquo;. Pa says that this
here house was built nigh thirty year ago by a fine
upstandin&rsquo; man as called himself Colonel Wadbury
and gave out that he&rsquo;d come from Virginia for his
gal&rsquo;s health. Pa said the gal was a sad-lookin&rsquo; creature
as ever he&rsquo;d set eyes on, an&rsquo; bye an&rsquo; bye &rsquo;twas
rumored around Siquaw that she was in love an&rsquo;
wantin&rsquo; to marry some furreigner, an&rsquo; that the old
Colonel had fetched her to this out-o&rsquo;-the-way place
so that he could keep watch on her. He sure sartin
built her a fine mansion to live in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pa said &rsquo;twas filled with paintin&rsquo;s of ancestors,
and books an&rsquo; queer furreign rugs a hangin&rsquo; on the
walls, though thar was plenty beside on the floor.
Pa&rsquo;d been to a museum up to Boston onct, an&rsquo; he
said as &rsquo;twas purty much like that inside the place.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_61">[61]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Wall, when &rsquo;twas all finished, the two tuk to livin&rsquo;
in it with a man servant an&rsquo; an old woman to keep
an eye on the gal, seemed like.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Twan&rsquo;t swamp around here in those days, &rsquo;twas
sand, and the Colonel had a plant put in that grew
all over&mdash;sand verbeny he called it, but folks in
Siquaw Center shook their heads, knowin&rsquo; as how
the day would come when the old sea would rise up
an&rsquo; claim its own, bein&rsquo; as that had all been ocean
onct on a time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pa says as how he tol&rsquo; the Colonel that he was
takin&rsquo; big chances, buildin&rsquo; a house as hefty as that
thar one, on nothin&rsquo; but sand, but that wan&rsquo;t all he
built either. Furst off &rsquo;twas a high sea wall to keep
the ocean back off his place, then &rsquo;twas a pier wi&rsquo;
lights along it, and then he fetched a yacht from
somewhere.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pa says he&rsquo;d never seen a craft like it, an&rsquo; he&rsquo;d
been a sea-farin&rsquo; man ever since the North Star tuk
to shinin&rsquo;, or a powerful long time, anyhow. That
yacht, Pa says, was the whitest, mos&rsquo; glistenin&rsquo; thing
he&rsquo;d ever sot eyes on. An&rsquo; graceful! When the
sailors, as wore white clothes, tuk to sailin&rsquo; it up and
down, Pa says folks from Siquaw Center tuk a holiday
just to come down to the shore to watch the
craft. It slid along so silent and was so all-over
white, Gus Pilsley, him as was school teacher days
and kep&rsquo; the poolhall nights, said it looked like a
&lsquo;phantom yacht,&rsquo; an&rsquo; that&rsquo;s what folks got to
callin&rsquo; it.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_62">[62]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Pa says it was well named, for, if ever a ghost
rode on it, &rsquo;twas the gal who went out sailin&rsquo; every
day. Sometimes the Colonel was with her, but most
times &rsquo;twas the old woman, but she never was let to
go alone. The Colonel&rsquo;s orders was that the sailors
shouldn&rsquo;t go beyond the three miles that was American.
He wasn&rsquo;t goin&rsquo; to have his gal sailin&rsquo; in waters
that was shared by no furreigners, him bein&rsquo; that sot
agin them, like as not because the gal wanted to
marry one of &rsquo;em. So day arter day, early and late,
Pa says, she sailed on her &lsquo;Phantom Yacht&rsquo; up and
down but keepin&rsquo; well this side o&rsquo; the island over
yonder.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_63">[63]</div>
<p>Gibralter had risen and was pointing out to sea.
The girls stood at his side shading their eyes.
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s it!&rdquo; he told them. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the island. It&rsquo;s
on the three-mile line, but Pa says it&rsquo;s the mos&rsquo;
treacherous island on this here coast, bein&rsquo; as thar&rsquo;s
hidden shoals fer half a mile all around it, an&rsquo; thar&rsquo;s
many a whitenin&rsquo; skeleton out thar of fishin&rsquo; boats
that went too close.&rdquo; The lad reseated himself and
the girls did likewise. Then he resumed the tale.
&ldquo;Wall, so it went on all summer long. Pa says if
you&rsquo;d look out at sunrise like&rsquo;s not thar&rsquo;d be that
yacht slidin&rsquo; silent-like up and down. Pa says it got
to hauntin&rsquo; him. He&rsquo;d even come down here on
moonlit nights an&rsquo;, sure nuf, thar&rsquo;d be that Phantom
Yacht glidin&rsquo; around, but one night suthin&rsquo; happened
as Pa says he&rsquo;ll never forget if he lives to be as old
as Methusalah&rsquo;s grandfather.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;W-what happened?&rdquo; the girls leaned forward.
&ldquo;Did the yacht run on the shoals?&rdquo; Nann asked
eagerly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_64">[64]</div>
<h2 id="c8"><br />CHAPTER VIII.
<br />WHAT HAPPENED</h2>
<p>Gibralter was thoroughly enjoying their suspense.
&ldquo;Wall,&rdquo; he drawled, making the moment as
dramatic as possible, &ldquo;&rsquo;long about midnight, once, Pa
heard a gallopin&rsquo; horse comin&rsquo; along the road from
the sea. Pa knew thar wan&rsquo;t no one as rode horseback
but the old Colonel himself, an&rsquo;, bein&rsquo; as he&rsquo;d
been gettin&rsquo; gouty, he hadn&rsquo;t been doin&rsquo; much ridin&rsquo;
of late days, Pa said, but thar was somethin&rsquo; about
the way the horse was gallopin&rsquo; that made Pa sit
right up in bed. He an&rsquo; Ma&rsquo;d jest been married an&rsquo;
started keepin&rsquo; house in the store right whar we live
now. Pa woke up and they both listened. Then
they heard someone hollerin&rsquo; an&rsquo; Pa knew &rsquo;twas the
old Colonel&rsquo;s voice, an&rsquo; Ma said, &lsquo;Like&rsquo;s not someone&rsquo;s
sick over to the mansion!&rsquo; Pa got into his
clothes fast as greased lightnin&rsquo;, took a lantern and
went down to the porch, and thar was the ol&rsquo; Colonel
wi&rsquo;out any hat on. His gray hair was all rumped
up and his eyes was wild-like. Pa said the ol&rsquo; Colonel
was brown as leather most times, but that night he
was white as sheets.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_65">[65]</div>
<p>&ldquo;As soon as the Colonel saw Pa, he hollered,
&lsquo;Whar kin I get a steam launch? I wanta foller my
daughter. She an&rsquo; the woman that takes keer o&rsquo; her
is plumb gone, an&rsquo;, what&rsquo;s more, my yacht&rsquo;s gone
too. They&rsquo;ve made off wi&rsquo; it. That scalawag of a
furriner that&rsquo;s been wantin&rsquo; to marry her has kidnapped
&rsquo;em all. She&rsquo;s only seventeen, my daughter
is, an&rsquo; I&rsquo;ll have the law on him.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pa said when he got up clost to the horse the
Colonel was ridin&rsquo;, he could see the old man was
shakin&rsquo; like he had the palsy. Pa didn&rsquo;t know no
place at all whar a steam launch could be had, leastwise
not near enuf to Siquaw to help any, so the old
Colonel said he&rsquo;d take the train an&rsquo; go up the coast
to a town whar he could get a launch an&rsquo; he&rsquo;d chase
arter that slow-sailin&rsquo; yacht an&rsquo; he&rsquo;d have the law on
whoever was kidnappin&rsquo; his daughter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The ol&rsquo; Colonel was in an awful state, Pa said.
He went into the store part o&rsquo; our house and paced
up an&rsquo; down, an&rsquo; up an&rsquo; down, an&rsquo; up an&rsquo; down, till
Pa thought he must be goin&rsquo; crazy, an&rsquo; every onct
in a while he&rsquo;d mutter, like &rsquo;twas just for himself
to hear, &lsquo;She&rsquo;ll pay fer this, Darlina will!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boy looked up and smiled at his listeners.
&ldquo;Queer name, wasn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; he queried. &ldquo;Most as
funny as my name, but I guess likely &rsquo;taint quite.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_66">[66]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose they wanted to call her something that
meant darling,&rdquo; Dories began, but Nann put in
eagerly with, &ldquo;Oh, Gib, do go on. What happened
next? Did the old Colonel go somewhere and get
a fast boat and overtake the yacht. I do hope that
he didn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wall, than yo&rsquo; get what yer hopin&rsquo; fer, all right.
About a week arter he&rsquo;d took the early mornin&rsquo; train
along back came the ol&rsquo; Colonel, Pa said, an&rsquo; he
looked ten year older. He didn&rsquo;t s&rsquo;plain nothin&rsquo;, but
gave Pa some money fer takin&rsquo; keer o&rsquo; his horse
while he&rsquo;d been gone, an&rsquo; then back he came here to
his house an&rsquo; lived shut in all by himself an&rsquo; his man-servant
for nigh ten year, Pa said. Nobody ever
set eyes on him; his man-servant bein&rsquo; the only one
who came to the store for mail an&rsquo; supplies, an&rsquo; he
never said nuthin&rsquo;, tho Pa said now an&rsquo; then he&rsquo;d
ask if Darlina&rsquo;d been heard from. He knew when
he&rsquo;d ask, Pa said, as how he wouldn&rsquo;t get any
answer, but he couldn&rsquo;t help askin&rsquo;; he was that interested.
But arter a time folks around here began
to think morne&rsquo;n like the Phantom Yacht, as Pa&rsquo;d
called it, had gone to the bottom before it reached
wherever &rsquo;twas they&rsquo;d been headin&rsquo; fer, when all of
a sudden somethin&rsquo; happened. Gee, but Pa said he&rsquo;d
never been so excited before in all his days as he
was the day that somethin&rsquo; happened. It was ten
year ago an&rsquo; Pa&rsquo;d jest had a letter from yer aunt&mdash;&rdquo;
the boy leaned over to nod at Dori, &ldquo;askin&rsquo; him to
go to the Point an&rsquo; open up her cottage as she&rsquo;d
built the summer before. Thar was only two cottages
on the shore then; hers an&rsquo; the Burtons&rsquo;, that&rsquo;s
nearest the point. Pa said as how he thought he&rsquo;d
get down thar before sun up, so&rsquo;s he could get back
in time to open up the store, bein&rsquo; as Ma wan&rsquo;t well,
an&rsquo; so he set off to walk to the beach.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_67">[67]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Pa said he was up on the roof of the front porch
takin&rsquo; the blind off thet little front window in the
loft whar yo&rsquo; girls sleep when the gray dawn over
to the east sort o&rsquo; got pink. Pa said &rsquo;twas such a
purty sight he turned &rsquo;round to watch it a spell when,
all of a sudden sailin&rsquo; right around that long, rocky
island out thar, <i>what</i> should he see but the Phantom
Yacht, her white sails glistening as the sun rose up
out o&rsquo; the water. Pa said he had to hold on, he was
so sure it was a spook boat. He couldn&rsquo;t no-how
believe &rsquo;twas real, but thar came up a spry wind wi&rsquo;
the sun an&rsquo; that yacht sailed as purty as could be
right up to the long dock whar the sailors tied it.
Wall, Pa said he was so flabbergasted that he fergot
all about the blind he was to take off an&rsquo; slid right
down the roof and made fer a place as near the long
dock as he could an&rsquo; hid behind some rocks an&rsquo;
waited. Pa said nothin&rsquo; happened fer two hours,
or seemed that long to him; then out of that yacht
stepped the mos&rsquo; beautiful young woman as Pa&rsquo;d
ever set eyes on. He knew at onct &rsquo;twas the ol&rsquo;
Colonel&rsquo;s daughter growed up. She was dressed all
in white jest like she&rsquo;d used to be, but what was
different was the two kids she had holdin&rsquo; on to her
hands. One was a boy, Pa said, about nine year old,
dressed in black velvet wi&rsquo; a white lace color. Pa
said he was a handsome little fellar, but &rsquo;twas the
wee girl, Pa said, that looked like a gold and white
angel wi&rsquo; long yellow curls. She was younger&rsquo;n the
boy by nigh two year, Pa reckoned. Their ma&rsquo;s
face was pale and looked like sufferin&rsquo;, Pa said, as
she an&rsquo; her children walked up to the sea wall and
went up over the stone steps thar was then to climb
over it. Pa knew they was goin&rsquo; on up to the house,
but from whar he hid he couldn&rsquo;t see no more, an&rsquo;
so bein&rsquo; as he had to go on back to open up the store,
he didn&rsquo;t see what the meetin&rsquo; between the ol&rsquo; Colonel
an&rsquo; his daughter was like. How-some-ever it couldn&rsquo;t
o&rsquo; been very pleasant, fer along about noon, Pa said
he recollected as how he had fergot to take off the
blind on yer aunt&rsquo;s cottage, an&rsquo; knowin&rsquo; how mad
she&rsquo;d be, he locked up the store an&rsquo; went back down
to the beach, an&rsquo; the first thing he saw was that
glistenin&rsquo; white yacht a-sailin&rsquo; away. The wind had
been gettin&rsquo; stiffer all the mornin&rsquo; an&rsquo; Pa said as he
watched the yacht roundin&rsquo; the island, it looked to
him like it was bound to go on the shoals an&rsquo; be
wrecked on the rocks. Whoever was steerin&rsquo; Pa
said, didn&rsquo;t seem to know nothin&rsquo; about the reefs.
Pa stood starin&rsquo; till the yacht was out of sight, an&rsquo;
then he heard a hollerin&rsquo; an&rsquo; yellin&rsquo; down the beach,
an&rsquo; thar come the ol&rsquo; man-servant runnin&rsquo; an&rsquo; stumblin&rsquo;
an&rsquo; shoutin&rsquo; to Pa to come quick.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_69">[69]</div>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Colonel Wadbury&rsquo;s took a stroke!&rsquo; was what he
was hollerin&rsquo;, an&rsquo; so Pa follered arter him as fast as
he could an&rsquo; when they got into the big library-room,
whar all the books an&rsquo; pictures was, Pa saw the ol&rsquo;
Colonel on the floor an&rsquo; his face was all drawed up
somethin&rsquo; awful. Pa helped the man-servant get
him to bed, and fer onct the man-servant was willin&rsquo;
to talk. He told Pa all that had happened. He said
how Darlina&rsquo;s furrin husband had died an&rsquo; how she
wanted to come back to America to live. She didn&rsquo;t
ask to live wi&rsquo; her Pa, but she did want him to give
her the deed to a country place near Boston. It
&rsquo;pears her ma had left it for her to have when she
got to be eighteen, but the ol&rsquo; Colonel wouldn&rsquo;t give
her the papers, though they was hers by rights, an&rsquo;
he wouldn&rsquo;t even look at the two children; he jest
turned &rsquo;em all right out, and then as soon as they
was gone, he tuk a stroke. &rsquo;Twan&rsquo;t likely, so Pa
said, he&rsquo;d ever be able to speak again. The man-servant
said as the last words the ol&rsquo; Colonel spoke
was to call a curse down on his daughter&rsquo;s head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wall, the curse come all right,&rdquo; Gibralter nodded
in the direction of the crumbling ruin, &ldquo;but &rsquo;twas
himself as it hit.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_70">[70]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll recollect awhile back I was mentionin&rsquo;
that folks in Siquaw Center had warned ol&rsquo; Colonel
Wadbury not to build a hefty house on shiftin&rsquo; sand
that was lower&rsquo;n the sea. Thar was nothin&rsquo; keepin&rsquo;
the water back but a wall o&rsquo; rocks. But the Colonel
sort o&rsquo; dared Fate to do its worst, and Fate tuk
the dare.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When November set in, Pa says, folks in town
began to take in reefs, so to speak; shuttin&rsquo; the
blinds over their windows and boltin&rsquo; &rsquo;em on to the
inside. Gettin&rsquo; ready for the nor&rsquo;easter that usually
came at that time o&rsquo; year, sort o&rsquo; headin&rsquo; the procession
o&rsquo; winter storms. Wall, it came all right; an&rsquo;
though &rsquo;twas allays purty lively, Pa says that one
beat all former records, and was a howlin&rsquo; hurricane.
Folks didn&rsquo;t put their heads out o&rsquo; doors, day or
night, while it lasted, an&rsquo; some of &rsquo;em camped in
their cellars. That thar storm had all the accompaniments.
Thar was hail beatin&rsquo; down as big and
hard as marbles, but the windows, havin&rsquo; blinds on
&rsquo;em, didn&rsquo;t get smashed. Then it warmed up some,
and how it rained! Pa says Noah&rsquo;s flood was a
dribble beside it, he&rsquo;s sure sartin. Then the wind
tuk a turn, and how it howled and blustered. All
the outbuildin&rsquo;s toppled right over; but the houses
in Siquaw Center was built to stand, and they stood.
Then on the third night, Pa says, &rsquo;long about midnight,
thar was a roarin&rsquo; noise, louder&rsquo;n wind or
rain. It was kinder far off at first, but seemed like
&rsquo;twas comin&rsquo; nearer. &lsquo;That thar stone wall&rsquo;s broke
down,&rsquo; Pa told Ma, &lsquo;an&rsquo; the sea&rsquo;s coverin&rsquo; the lowland.&rsquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_71">[71]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Wall, Pa was right. The tide had never risen
so high in the memory of Ol&rsquo; Timer as had been
around these parts nigh a hundred years. The
waves had banged agin that wall till it went down;
then they swirled around the house till they dug the
sand out an&rsquo; the walls fell jest like yo&rsquo; see &rsquo;em now.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The next mornin&rsquo; the sky was clear an&rsquo; smilin&rsquo;,
as though nothin&rsquo; had happened, or else as though
&rsquo;twas pleased with its work. Pa and Gus Pilsley
an&rsquo; some other Siquaw men made for the coast to
see what the damage had been, but they couldn&rsquo;t get
within half a mile, bein&rsquo; as the road was under
water. How-some-ever, &rsquo;bout a week later, the road,
bein&rsquo; higher, dried; but the water never left the lowlands,
an&rsquo; that&rsquo;s how the swamp come all about the
old ruin&mdash;reeds and things grew up, just like &rsquo;tis
today.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pa and Gus come up to this here point an&rsquo; looked
down at what was left of the fine stone house.
&lsquo;&rsquo;Pears like it served him right,&rsquo; was what the two
of &rsquo;em said. Then they went away, and the ol&rsquo; place
was left alone. Folks never tried to get to the ruin,
sayin&rsquo; as the marsh around it was oozy, and would
draw a body right in.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_72">[72]</div>
<p>&ldquo;But what became of old Colonel Wadbury and
the man-servant?&rdquo; Dories inquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dunno,&rdquo; the boy replied, laconically. &ldquo;Some
thar be as guess one thing, and some another. Ol&rsquo;
Timer said as how he&rsquo;d seen two men board the
train that passes through Siquaw Center &rsquo;long &rsquo;bout
two in the mornin&rsquo;, but Pa says the storm was
fiercest then, and no trains went through for three
days; and who&rsquo;d be out to see, if it had? Pa thinks
they tried to get away an&rsquo; was washed out to sea an&rsquo;
drowned, an&rsquo; I guess likely that&rsquo;s what happened,
all right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dories rose. &ldquo;We ought to be getting back.&rdquo; She
glanced at the sun as she spoke. &ldquo;Aunt Jane may
be needing us.&rdquo; The other two stood up and for a
moment Nann gazed down at the ruin; then she
called to it: &ldquo;Some day I am coming to visit you,
old house, and find out the secret that you hold.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dories shuddered and seemed glad to climb down
on the side of the rocks where the sun was shining
so brightly and from where one could not see the
dismal swamp and the crumbling old ruin.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_73">[73]</div>
<h2 id="c9"><br />CHAPTER IX.
<br />A MYSTERIOUS MESSAGE</h2>
<p>As they walked along the hard, glistening beach,
Nann glanced over the shimmering water at the
gray, forbidding-looking island in the distance,
almost as though she thought that the Phantom
Yacht might again be seen sailing toward the place
where the dock had been. &ldquo;Poor Darlina,&rdquo; she said
turning toward the others, &ldquo;how I do hope that she
is happy now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cain&rsquo;t no one tell as to that, I reckon,&rdquo; Gib commented,
when Dories asked: &ldquo;Gibralter, how long
ago did all this happen? How old would that girl
and boy be now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pa was speakin&rsquo; o&rsquo; that &rsquo;long about last week,&rdquo;
was the reply. &ldquo;He reckoned &rsquo;twas ten year since
the Phantom Yacht sailed off agin with the mother
and the two little uns. That&rsquo;d make the boy, Pa
said, about nineteen year old he cal&rsquo;lated, an&rsquo; the wee
girl about fifteen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then little Darlina would be about our age,&rdquo;
Dories commented.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_74">[74]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Why do you think that her name would be the
same as her mother&rsquo;s?&rdquo; Nann queried.</p>
<p>&ldquo;O, just because it is odd and pretty,&rdquo; was Dories&rsquo;
reason. Then, stepping more spryly, she said: &ldquo;I
do hope Aunt Jane has not been awake long, fretting
for her breakfast. We&rsquo;ve been gone over two hours
I do believe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gee!&rdquo; Gib exclaimed, looking around for his
horse. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have ter gallop as fast as the ol&rsquo; colonel
did that thar night I was tellin&rsquo; yo&rsquo; about or Pa&rsquo;ll
be in my wool. I&rsquo;d ought to&rsquo;ve had the milkin&rsquo; done
this hour past. So long!&rdquo; he added, bolting suddenly
between two of the boarded-up cottages they
were passing. &ldquo;Thar&rsquo;s my ol&rsquo; steed out by the
marsh,&rdquo; he called back to them.</p>
<p>The girls entered the kitchen very quietly and tiptoed
through the living-room hoping that their
elderly hostess had not yet awakened, but a querulous
voice was calling: &ldquo;Dories, is that you? Why
can&rsquo;t you be more quiet? I&rsquo;ve heard you prowling
around this house for the past hour. Going up and
down those outside stairs. I should think you would
know that I want quiet. I came here to rest my
nerves. Bring my coffee at once.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_75">[75]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Aunt Jane,&rdquo; the girl meekly replied. Then,
darting back to the kitchen, she whispered, her eyes
wide and startled, &ldquo;Nann, somebody has been in this
house while we&rsquo;ve been away. I do believe it was
that&mdash;that person we saw at midnight carrying a
lantern. Aunt Jane has heard footsteps creaking up
and down the stairs to our room.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nann&rsquo;s expression was very strange. Instead of
replying she held out a small piece of crumpled
paper. &ldquo;I just ran up to the loft to get my apron,&rdquo;
she said, &ldquo;and I found this lying in the middle of
our bed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On the paper was written in small red letters: &ldquo;In
thirteen days you shall know all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have nine minds to tell Aunt Jane that the cabin
must be haunted and that we ought to leave for
Boston this very day,&rdquo; Dories said, but her companion
detained her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t, Dori,&rdquo; she implored. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure that there
is nothing that will harm us, for pray, why should
anyone want to? And I&rsquo;m simply wild to know,
well, just ever so many things. Who prowls about
at midnight carrying a lighted lantern, what he is
hunting for, who left this crumpled paper on our
bed, and what we are to know in thirteen days; but,
first of all, I want to find a way to enter that old
ruin.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_76">[76]</div>
<p>Dories sank down on a kitchen chair. &ldquo;Nann
Sibbett,&rdquo; she gasped, &ldquo;I believe that you are absolutely
the only girl in this whole world who is without
fear. Well,&rdquo; more resignedly, &ldquo;if you aren&rsquo;t
afraid, I&rsquo;ll try not to be.&rdquo; Then, springing up, she
added, for the querulous voice had again called:
&ldquo;Yes, Aunt Jane, I&rsquo;ll bring your coffee soon.&rdquo; Turning
to Nann, she added: &ldquo;We ought to have a
calendar so that we could count the days.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess we won&rsquo;t need to.&rdquo; Nann was making
a fire in the stove as she spoke. &ldquo;More than likely
the spook will count them for us. There, isn&rsquo;t that
a jolly fire? Polly, put the kettle on, and we&rsquo;ll soon
have coffee.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dories, being the &ldquo;Polly&rdquo; her friend was addressing,
announced that she was ravenously hungry
after their long walk and climb and that she was
going to have bacon and eggs. Nann said merrily,
&ldquo;Double the order.&rdquo; Then, while Dories was preparing
the menu, she said softly: &ldquo;Nann, doesn&rsquo;t it
seem queer to you that Great-Aunt Jane can live on
nothing but toast and tea? Of course,&rdquo; she amended,
&ldquo;this morning she wishes toast and coffee, but she
surely ought to eat more than that, shouldn&rsquo;t you
think?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She would if she got out in this bracing sea air,
but lying abed is different. One doesn&rsquo;t get so
hungry.&rdquo; Nann was setting the kitchen table for
two as she talked. After the old woman&rsquo;s tray had
been carried to her bedside, Dories and Nann ate
ravenously of the plain, but tempting, fare which
they had cooked for themselves. Nann laughed
merrily. &ldquo;This certainly is a lark,&rdquo; she exclaimed.
&ldquo;I never before had such a good time. I&rsquo;ve always
been crazy to read mystery stories and here we are
living one.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_77">[77]</div>
<p>Dories shrugged. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m inclined to think that I&rsquo;d
rather read about spooks than meet them,&rdquo; she remarked
as she rose and prepared to wash the dishes.</p>
<p>When the kitchen had been tidied, the two girls
went into the sun-flooded living-room, and began to
make it look more homelike. The dust covers were
removed from the comfortable wicker chairs and
the pictures, that had been turned to face the walls
while the cabin was unoccupied, were dusted and
straightened.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, let&rsquo;s take a run along the beach and gather
a nice lot of drift wood,&rdquo; Nann suggested. &ldquo;You
know Gibralter told us that this is the time of year
when the first winter storm is likely to arrive.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dories shuddered. &ldquo;I hope it won&rsquo;t be like the
one that wrecked Colonel Wadbury&rsquo;s house eight
years ago. If it were, it might undermine all of
these cabins, and, how pray, could we escape if the
road was under water?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, that isn&rsquo;t likely to happen,&rdquo; Nann said comfortingly.
&ldquo;Our beach is higher than that lowland.
It it does, we&rsquo;d find a way out, but, Dories, please
don&rsquo;t be imagining things. We have enough mystery
to puzzle us without conjuring up frightful
catastrophes that probably never will happen.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_78">[78]</div>
<p>Dories stopped at her aunt&rsquo;s door to tell her their
plans, but the old woman was either asleep or feined
slumber, and so, tiptoeing that she might not disturb
her, the girl went out on the beach, where Nann
awaited her. They were hatless, and as the sun had
mounted higher, even the bright colored sweater-coats
had been discarded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s such a perfect Indian summer day,&rdquo; Nann
said. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t even see a tiny, misty cloud.&rdquo; As
she spoke, she shaded her eyes with one hand and
scanned the horizon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t the island clear? Even that fog bank that
we saw early this morning has melted away.&rdquo; Then,
whirling about, Dories inquired, &ldquo;Nann, if we
should see something white coming around that
bleak gray island, what do you think it would be?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, the Phantom Yacht, of course.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What would you do, if it were?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, Dori. I hadn&rsquo;t even thought of
the coming of that boat as a possibility, and yet&mdash;&rdquo;
Nann turned a glowing face, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know why it
might not happen. That little woman, for the sake
of her children, might try a second time to win her
father&rsquo;s forgiveness. If she came, what a desolate
homecoming it would be; the old house in ruin and
the fate of her father unknown.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_79">[79]</div>
<p>For a moment the two girls stood silent. A gentle
sea breeze blew their sport skirts about them. They
watched the island with shaded eyes as though they
really expected the yacht to appear. Then Nann
laughed, and leaping along the beach, she confessed:
&ldquo;I know that I&rsquo;ll keep watching for the return of
the Phantom Yacht just all of the while. The first
thing in the morning and the last thing at night.&rdquo;
Then, as she picked up a piece of whitening driftwood,
she asked, &ldquo;Dori, would you rather have the
glistening white yacht appear in the sunrise or in
the moonlight?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dories had darted for another piece of wood
higher up the warm beach, but, on returning, she
replied: &ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t know; either way would make
a beautiful picture, I should think.&rdquo; Then, after
picking up another piece, she added: &ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to
meet that pretty gold and white girl, wouldn&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe we will,&rdquo; Nann commented, then sang
out: &ldquo;Do look, Dori, over by the point of rocks,
there is ever so much driftwood. I believe that will
be enough to fill our wood shed if we carry it all in.
I&rsquo;ve always heard that there are such pretty colors
in the flames when driftwood burns.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girls worked for a while carrying the wood
to the shed; then they climbed up on the rocks to
rest, but not high enough to see the old ruin. When
at length the sun was at the zenith, they went indoors
to prepare lunch, and again the old woman
asked only for toast and tea.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_80">[80]</div>
<p>After a leisurely noon hour, the girls returned to
their task; there really being nothing else that they
wanted to do, and, as Nann suggested, if the rains
came they would be well prepared. For a time they
rested, lying full length on the warm sand, and so it
was not until late afternoon that they had carried
in all of the driftwood they could find.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Goodness!&rdquo; Dories exclaimed, shudderingly, as
she looked down at her last armful. &ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t it
make you feel queer to know that this wood is probably
the broken-up skeleton of a ship that has been
wrecked at sea?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose that is true,&rdquo; was the thoughtful response.
They had started for the cabin, and a late
afternoon fog was drifting in.</p>
<p>Suddenly Nann paused and stared at the one window
in the loft that faced the sea. Her expression
was more puzzled than fearful. For one brief second
she had seen a white object pass that window.
Dories turned to ask why her friend had delayed.
Nann, not wishing to frighten the more timid girl,
stooped to pick up a piece of driftwood that had
slipped from her arms.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m coming, dear,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_81">[81]</div>
<p>On reaching the cabin, Nann went at once to the
room of the elderly woman, who had told them in
the morning that she intended to remain in bed for
one week and be waited on. There she was, her
deeply-set dark eyes watching the door when Nann
opened it and instantly she began to complain: &ldquo;I
do wish you girls wouldn&rsquo;t go up and down those
outside stairs any oftener than you have to. They
creaked so about ten minutes ago, they woke me
right up.&rdquo; Then she added, &ldquo;Please tell Dories to
bring me my tea at once.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nann returned to the kitchen truly puzzled. It
was always when they were away from the cabin
that the aunt heard someone going up and down the
outside stairway. What could it mean? To Dories
she said, in so calm a voice that suspicion was not
aroused in the heart of her friend, &ldquo;While you prepare
the tea for your aunt, I&rsquo;ll go up to the loft
room and make our bed before dark.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dories had said truly, Nann Sibbett seemed to be
a girl without fear.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_82">[82]</div>
<h2 id="c10"><br />CHAPTER X.
<br />SOUNDS IN THE LOFT</h2>
<p>Nann half believed that the white object she had
seen at the loft window was but a flashing ray of
the setting sun reflected from the opposite window
which faced the west, and yet, curiosity prompted
her to go to the loft and be sure that it was unoccupied.
This resolution was strengthened when, upon
reaching the cabin, she heard Miss Moore&rsquo;s querulous
voice complaining that the outer stairs leading
to the room above had been creaking constantly, and
she requested the girls not to go up and down so
often while she was trying to sleep. Nann, knowing
that they had not been to their bedroom since
morning, was a little puzzled by this, and so, bidding
Dories prepare tea for her great-aunt, she went out
on the back porch and started to ascend the stairway.
When the top was reached, she discovered
that the door was locked. For a puzzled moment
the girl believed that the key was on the inside, but,
stopping, she found that she could see through the
keyhole. Although it was dusk, the window in
the loft room, which opened toward the sea, was
opposite and showed a faint reflection of the setting
sun. Nann was relieved but still puzzled, when a
whispered voice at the foot of the stairway called to
her. Turning, Nann saw Dories standing in the
dim light below, holding up the key. &ldquo;Did you forget
that we brought it down?&rdquo; she inquired.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_83">[83]</div>
<p>As Nann hurriedly descended, she noticed that
the stairs did not creak, nor indeed could they, for
each step was one solid board firmly wedged in
grooves at the sides.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe that we are all of us allowing our
imaginations to run away with us, Miss Moore included,&rdquo;
Nann said as she returned to the kitchen.
Then added, &ldquo;Instead of making our bed now, I will
clean the glass lamps and fill them with the oil that
Gibralter brought while it is still twilighty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This she did, setting briskly to work and humming
a gay little tune.</p>
<p>It never would do for Nann Sibbett, the fearless,
to allow her imagination to run riot.</p>
<p>Before the lamps were ready to be lighted, the
fog, which stole in every night from the sea, had
settled about the cabin and the fog horn out beyond
the rocky point had started its constantly recurring,
long drawn-out wail.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Goodness!&rdquo; Dories said, shudderingly, &ldquo;listen to
that!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_84">[84]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m listening!&rdquo; Nann replied briskly. &ldquo;I rather
like it. It&rsquo;s so sort of appropriate. You know, at
the movies, when the Indians come on, the weird
Indian music always begins. Now, that&rsquo;s the way
with the fog.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She paused to scratch a match, applied the flame
to the oil-saturated wick of a small glass lamp and
stood back admiringly. &ldquo;There, friend o&rsquo; mine,&rdquo;
she exclaimed, &ldquo;isn&rsquo;t that cheerful?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dories, instead of looking at the circle of light
about the lamp, looked at the wavering shadows in
the corners, then at the heavy gray fog which hung
like curtains at the windows. She huddled closer to
the stove. &ldquo;If this place spells cheerfulness to you,&rdquo;
she remarked, &ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to know what would be
dismal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nann whirled about and faced her friend and for
a moment she was serious.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to preach,&rdquo; she threatened, &ldquo;so be
prepared. I haven&rsquo;t the least bit of use in this world
for people who are mercurial. What right have we
to mope about and create a dismal atmosphere in
our homes, just because we can&rsquo;t see the sunshine.
We know positively that it is shining somewhere,
and we also know that the clouds never last long.
I call it superlative selfishness to be variable in disposition.
Pray, why should we impose our doleful
moods on our friends?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_85">[85]</div>
<p>Then, noting the downcast expression of her
friend, Nann put her arms about her as she said
penitently, &ldquo;Forgive me, dear, if I hurt your feelings.
Of course it is dismal here and we could be
just miserable if we wanted to be, but isn&rsquo;t it far
better to think of it all as an adventure, a merry
lark? We know perfectly well that there is no such
thing as a ghost, but the setting for one is so perfect
we just can&rsquo;t resist the temptation to pretend
that&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nann said no more for something had suddenly
banged in the loft room over their heads.</p>
<p>Dories sat up with a start, but Nann laughed gleefully.
&ldquo;You see, even the ghost knows his cue,&rdquo; she
declared. &ldquo;He came into the story just at the right
moment. He can&rsquo;t scare me, however,&rdquo; Nann continued,
&ldquo;for I know exactly what made the bang.
When I was upstairs I noticed that the blind to the
front window had come unfastened, and now that
the night wind is rising, the two conspired to make
us think a ghost had invaded our chamber.&rdquo; Then,
having placed a lighted lamp on the kitchen table and
another on a shelf near the stove, the optimistic girl
whirled and with arms akimbo she exclaimed, &ldquo;Mistress
Dori, what will we have for supper? You
forage in the supply cupboard and bring forth your
choice. I vote for hot chocolate!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_86">[86]</div>
<p>&ldquo;How would asparagus tips do on toast?&rdquo; This
doubtfully from the girl peering into a closet where
stood row after row of bags and cans.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Great!&rdquo; was the merry reply. &ldquo;And we&rsquo;ll have
canned raspberries and wafers for desert.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was seven when the meal was finished and
nearly eight when the kitchen was tidied. Nann
noticed that Dories seemed intentionally slow and
that every now and then she seemed to be listening
for sounds from above. Ignoring it, however, Nann
put out the light in one lamp and, taking the other,
she exclaimed, &ldquo;The earlier we go to bed, the earlier
we can get up, and I&rsquo;m heaps more interested in
being awake by day than by night, aren&rsquo;t you, Dori?
Are you all ready?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dories nodded, preparing to follow her friend
out into the fog that hung like a damp, dense mantle
on the back porch. But, as soon as the door was
opened, a cold, penetrating wind blew out the flame.
&ldquo;How stupid of me!&rdquo; Nann exclaimed, backing into
the kitchen and closing the door. &ldquo;I should have
lighted the lantern. Now stand still where you are,
Dori, and I&rsquo;ll grope around and find where I left it
after I filled it. Didn&rsquo;t you think I hung it on the
nail in the corner? Well, if I did, it isn&rsquo;t there. Get
the matches, dear, will you, and strike one so that
I can see.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_87">[87]</div>
<p>But that did not prove to be necessary, as a sudden
flaming-up of the dying fire in the stove revealed the
lantern standing on the floor near the oil can. Nann
pounced on it, found a match before the glow was
gone, and then, when the lantern sent forth its rather
faint illumination, they again ventured out into
the fog.</p>
<p>All the way up the back stairway Dories expected
to hear a bang in the room overhead, but there was
no sound. She peered over Nann&rsquo;s shoulder when
the door was opened and the faint light penetrated
the darkness. &ldquo;See, I was right!&rdquo; Nann whispered
triumphantly. &ldquo;The blind blew shut and the hook
caught it. That&rsquo;s why we didn&rsquo;t hear it again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s leave it shut,&rdquo; Dories suggested, &ldquo;then we
won&rsquo;t be able to see the lantern out on the point
of rocks if it moves about at midnight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nann, realizing that her companion really was
excitedly fearful, thought best to comply with her
request, and, as there was plenty of air entering the
loft room through innumerable cracks, she knew
they would not smother.</p>
<p>Too, Dories wanted the lantern left burning, but
as soon as Nann was sure that her companion was
asleep, she stealthily rose and blew out the flickering
flame.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_88">[88]</div>
<h2 id="c11"><br />CHAPTER XI.
<br />A QUERULOUS OLD AUNT</h2>
<p>It was daylight when the girls awakened and the
sun was streaming into their bedroom. Nann leaped
to her feet. &ldquo;It must be late,&rdquo; she declared as she
felt under her pillow for her wristwatch. She drew
it forth, but with it came a piece of crumpled yellow
paper on which in small red letters was written,
&ldquo;In twelve days you shall know all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dories luckily had not as yet opened her eyes and
Nann was sitting on the edge of the bed with her
back toward her companion. For a moment she
looked into space meditatively. Should she keep all
knowledge of that bit of paper to herself? She
decided that she would, and slipping it into the
pocket of her sweater-coat, which hung on a chair,
she rose and walked across the room to gaze at the
door. She remembered distinctly that she had
locked it. How could anyone have entered? Not
for one moment did the girl believe that their visitor
had been a ghostly apparition that could pass
through walls and locked doors.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_89">[89]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Hmm! I see,&rdquo; she concluded after a second&rsquo;s
scrutiny. &ldquo;I did lock the door, but I removed the
key and put it on the table. A pass-key evidently
admitted our visitor.&rdquo; Then, while dressing, Nann
continued to soliloquize. &ldquo;I wonder if the person
who walks the cliff carrying the lantern was our
visitor. Perhaps it&rsquo;s the old Colonel himself or his
man-servant who hides during the day under the
leaning part of the roof, but who walks forth at
night for exercise and air, although surely there
must be air enough in a house that has only one
wall.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Having completed her toilet, she shook her friend.
&ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t wake up soon, you won&rsquo;t be downstairs
in time for breakfast,&rdquo; she exclaimed.</p>
<p>Dories sat up with a startled cry. &ldquo;Oh, Nann,&rdquo;
she pleaded. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t go down and leave me up here
alone, please don&rsquo;t! I&rsquo;ll be dressed before you can
say Jack Robinson, if only you will wait.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ll be opening this window. I want to see
the ocean.&rdquo; As Nann spoke, she lifted the hook and
swung out the blind, then exclaimed:</p>
<p>&ldquo;How wonderfully blue the water is! Oho, someone
is out in the cove with a flat-bottomed boat.
Why, I do believe it is our friend Gibralter. Come
to think of it, he did say that he had been saving his
money for ever so long to buy what he calls a sailing
punt.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_90">[90]</div>
<p>Nann leaned out of the open window and waved
her handkerchief. Then she turned back to smile
at her friend. &ldquo;It is Gib and he&rsquo;s sailing toward
shore. Do hurry, Dori, let&rsquo;s run down to the beach
and call to him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tiptoeing down the flight of stairs, the two girls,
taking hands, scrambled over the bank to the hard
sand that was glistening in the sun.</p>
<p>The boy, having seen them, turned his boat toward
shore, and, as there was very little wind, he let the
sail flap and began rowing.</p>
<p>The tide was low and there was almost no surf.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Want to come out?&rdquo; he called as soon as he was
within hailing distance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, how I wish we could,&rdquo; Nann, the fearless,
replied, &ldquo;but we have duties to attend to first. Come
back in about an hour and maybe we&rsquo;ll be ready
to go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right-ho!&rdquo; the sea breeze brought to them,
then the lad turned into the rising wind, pulled in
the sheet and scudded away from the shore.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That surely looks like jolly sport,&rdquo; Nann declared
as, with arms locked, the two girls stood on
a boulder, watching for a moment. Then, &ldquo;We
ought to go in, for Great-Aunt Jane may have awakened,&rdquo;
Dories said.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_91">[91]</div>
<p>When the girls tiptoed to the chamber on the lower
floor, they found Miss Moore unusually fretful.
&ldquo;What a noisy night it was,&rdquo; she declared, peevishly.
&ldquo;I came to this place for a complete rest and I just
couldn&rsquo;t sleep a wink. I don&rsquo;t see why you girls
have to walk around in the night. Don&rsquo;t you know
that you are right over my head and every noise you
make sounds as though it were right in this very
room?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry you were disturbed, Aunt Jane,&rdquo; Dories
said, but she was indeed puzzled. Neither she nor
Nann had awakened from the hour that they retired
until sunrise.</p>
<p>When the girls were in the kitchen preparing
breakfast, Dories asked, &ldquo;Nann, do you think that
Great-Aunt Jane may be&mdash;I don&rsquo;t like to say it, but
you know how elderly people do, sometimes, wander
mentally.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, dear,&rdquo; the other replied, &ldquo;I do not think
that is true of your aunt.&rdquo; Then chancing to put
her hand in the pocket of her sweater-coat, and feeling
there the crumpled paper, Nann drew it out and
handed it to Dories.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, where did you find it?&rdquo; that astonished
maiden inquired when she had read the finely written
words, &ldquo;In twelve days you shall know all.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_92">[92]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Under my pillow,&rdquo; was the reply, &ldquo;and so you
see who ever leaves these messages has no desire to
harm us, hence there is no reason for us to be afraid.
At first I thought that I would not tell you, but I
want you to understand that your Great Aunt Jane
may have heard footsteps over her head last night,
even though we did not awaken.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, if you are not afraid, I&rsquo;ll try not to be,&rdquo;
Dories assured her friend, but in her heart she knew
that she would be glad indeed when the twelve days
were over.</p>
<p>Later when Dories went into her aunt&rsquo;s room to
remove the breakfast tray, she bent over the bed
to arrange the pillows more comfortably. Then she
tripped about, tidying the room. Chancing to turn,
she found the dark, deeply sunken eyes of the elderly
woman watching her with an expression that was
hard to define. Jane Moore smiled faintly at the
girl, and there was a tone of wistfulness in her voice
as she said, &ldquo;I suppose you and Nann will be away
all day again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, Aunt Jane,&rdquo; Dories heard herself saying
as she went to the bedside, &ldquo;were you lonely? Would
you like to have me stay for a while this morning
and read to you?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_93">[93]</div>
<p>Even as she spoke she seemed to see her mother&rsquo;s
smiling face and hear her say, &ldquo;The only ghosts that
haunt us are the memories of loving deeds left undone
and kind words that might have been spoken.&rdquo;
As yet Dories had not even thought of trying to do
anything to add to her aunt&rsquo;s pleasure. She was
gratified to see the brightening expression. &ldquo;Well,
that would be nice! If you will read to me until I
fall asleep, I shall indeed be glad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nann, who had come to the door, had heard, and,
as the girls left the room, she slipped an arm about
her friend, saying, &ldquo;That was mighty nice of you,
Dori, for I know how much pleasanter it would be
for you to go for a boat ride with Gibralter. I&rsquo;ll
stay with you if you wish.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, indeed, Nann. You go and see if you can&rsquo;t
find another clue to the mystery.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I feel in my bones that we will,&rdquo; that maiden
replied as she poured hot water over the few breakfast
dishes. &ldquo;It would be rather a good joke on&mdash;well&mdash;on
the ghost, if we solved the mystery sooner
than twelve days. Don&rsquo;t you think so?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But there are so many things that puzzle us,&rdquo;
Dories protested. &ldquo;I wish we might catch whoever
it is leaving those messages. That, at least, would
be one mystery solved.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you what,&rdquo; Nann said brightly. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s
put on our thinking caps and try to find some way
to trap the ghost tonight. Well, good-bye for now!
Gib and I will be back soon, I am sure. I&rsquo;m just
wild to go for a little sail with him in his queer
punt boat.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_94">[94]</div>
<p>Dories stood in the open front door watching as
her friend ran lightly across the hard sand, climbed
to a boulder and beckoned to the boy who was not
far away.</p>
<p>With a half sigh Dories went into her aunt&rsquo;s room.
Catching a glimpse of her own reflection in a mirror
she was surprised to behold a fretful expression
which plainly told that she was doing something
that she did not want to do in the least. She smiled,
and then turning toward the bed, she asked, &ldquo;What
shall I read, Aunt Jane?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are there any books in the living room?&rdquo; the
elderly woman inquired. The girl shook her head.
&ldquo;There are shelves, but the books have been removed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a sudden brightening of the deeply
sunken eyes. &ldquo;I recall now,&rdquo; the older woman said,
&ldquo;the books were packed in a box and taken up to the
loft. Suppose you go up there and select any book
that you would like to read.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For one panicky moment Dories felt that she must
refuse to go alone to that loft room which she believed
was haunted. She had never been up there
without Nann.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, are you going?&rdquo; The inquiry was not impatient,
but it was puzzled. &ldquo;Yes, Aunt Jane, I&rsquo;ll
go at once.&rdquo; There was nothing for the girl to do
but go. Taking the key from its place in the kitchen,
she began to ascend the outdoor stairway. How she
did wish that she were as fearless as Nann.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_95">[95]</div>
<p>The door opened when the key turned, and Dories
stood looking about her as though she half believed
that someone would appear, either from under the
bed or from behind the curtains that sheltered one
corner.</p>
<p>There was no sound, and, moreover, the loft room
was flooded with sunlight. The box, holding the
books, was readily found. Dories approached it,
lifted the cover and was about to search for an interesting
title when a mouse leaped out, scattering
gnawed bits of paper. Seizing the book on top,
Dories fled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is the matter?&rdquo; her aunt inquired when,
almost breathless, the girl entered her room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh&mdash;I&mdash;I thought it was&mdash;but it wasn&rsquo;t&mdash;it was
only a mouse.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course it was only a mouse,&rdquo; Miss Moore
said. &ldquo;I sincerely hope that a niece of mine is not
a coward.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope not, Aunt Jane.&rdquo; Then the girl for the
first time glanced at the book she held. The title was
&ldquo;Famous Ghost Stories of England and Ireland.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very entertaining, indeed,&rdquo; the elderly woman
remarked, as she settled back among the pillows, and
there was nothing for Dories to do but read one hair-raising
tale after another. Often she glanced at her
wrist-watch. It was almost noon. Why didn&rsquo;t
Nann come?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_96">[96]</div>
<h2 id="c12"><br />CHAPTER XII.
<br />A BLEACHED SKELETON</h2>
<p>When Gibralter saw Nann crossing the wide
beach that was shimmering in the light of the early
morning sun, he turned the punt boat and sailed as
close to the point of rocks as he dared go. Then,
letting the sail flap, he took the oars and was soon
alongside a large flat boulder which, at low tide, was
uncovered, although an occasional wave did wash
over it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quick! Watch whar ye step,&rdquo; he cautioned.
&ldquo;Thar now. Here&rsquo;s yer chance. Heave ho.&rdquo; Then
he added admiringly as the girl stepped into the
middle of the punt without losing her balance,
&ldquo;Bully fer you. That&rsquo;s as steady as a boy could
have done it. Whar&rsquo;s the other gal? Was she
skeered to come?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nann seated herself on the wide stern seat of the
flat-bottomed boat before she replied. &ldquo;Dori wanted
to come just ever so much, but she thought that she
ought to stay at home this morning and read to her
Great-Aunt Jane.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_97">[97]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Wall, I don&rsquo;t envy her none,&rdquo; the lad said as he
stood up to push the boat away from the rocks.
&ldquo;That ol&rsquo; Miss Moore is sure sartin the crabbiest
sort o&rsquo; a person seems like to me.&rdquo; Then as he sat
on the gunnel and pulled on the sheet, he added,
beaming at the girl, &ldquo;Say, Miss Nann, are ye game
to sail over clost to the island yonder? Like&rsquo;s not
we&rsquo;d find the skeleton o&rsquo; The Phantom Yacht if it
got wrecked thar, as Pa thinks mabbe it did.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Gib,&rdquo; the girl&rsquo;s voice expressed real concern,
&ldquo;I do hope that beautiful snow-white yacht was not
wrecked. I don&rsquo;t believe that it was. I feel sure
that those sailors took it safely back across the sea
with that poor heart-broken mother and the boy who
was such a handsome little chap, and the wee gold
and white girl whom your daddy said looked like a
lily. Honestly, Gib, I&rsquo;d almost rather not sail over
to that cruel island where so many boats have gone
down. If the Phantom Yacht is there, I&rsquo;d rather not
know it. I&rsquo;d heaps rather believe that it is still sailing,
perhaps on the blue, blue waters of the Mediterranean.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boy looked his disappointment. &ldquo;I say, Miss
Nann,&rdquo; he pleaded, &ldquo;come on, say you&rsquo;ll go, just this
onct. I&rsquo;m powerful curious to see what the shoals
look like. I&rsquo;ve been savin&rsquo; and savin&rsquo; for ever so
long to buy this here punt boat jest so&rsquo;s I could cruise
around over thar. Miss Nann, won&rsquo;t you go?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_98">[98]</div>
<p>The girl laughed. &ldquo;Gibralter, you look the picture
of distress. I just can&rsquo;t be hard-hearted enough to
disappoint you. If you&rsquo;ll promise not to wreck me,
I&rsquo;ll consent to go at least near enough to see just
what the island looks like.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With that promise the boy had to be content. A
brisk breeze was blowing from the land and so, before
very long, the two and a half miles that lay
between the shore and the outer shoals were covered
and the long gaunt island of jagged gray rocks
loomed large before them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The shoals&rsquo;ll come up, sudden-like, clost to the
top of the water, most any time now,&rdquo; Gib said, &ldquo;so
keep watchin&rsquo; ahead. If you see a place whar the
color&rsquo;s different, sort o&rsquo; shallow lookin&rsquo;, jest sing
out an&rsquo; I&rsquo;ll pull away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nann, thrilling with the excitement of a new adventure,
looked over the side of the punt and into
water so deep and dark green that it seemed bottomless,
but all at once they sailed right over a sharp-pointed
rock. Then another appeared, and another.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gib!&rdquo; the girl&rsquo;s cry was startled, &ldquo;you&rsquo;d better
stop sailing now and take the oars, slowly, for if we
hit a rock, way out here, and capsize, pray, who
would there be to save us?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_99">[99]</div>
<p>Nann shuddered as she gazed ahead at the gray,
grim island. A flock of long-legged, long-beaked
and altogether ungainly looking seabirds arose from
the rocks with shrill, unearthly screams, and, after
circling overhead for a moment they landed a safe
distance away. There was no other sign of life.</p>
<p>Gibralter let the sail flap at the girl&rsquo;s suggestion
and began to row slowly along on the sheltered side
of the island.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hark!&rdquo; Nann said, lifting one hand. &ldquo;Just hear
how the surf is pounding on the outer coast. Don&rsquo;t
go too far, Gib; see how the water swirls around
the rocks where they jut out into the sea.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As he rowed slowly along, the boy kept a keen-eyed
watch along the shore. &ldquo;Thar&rsquo;d ought to be a
place whar a body could land safely,&rdquo; he said at last.
Then added excitedly as he pointed: &ldquo;Look&rsquo;et; thar&rsquo;s
a big flat shoal that goes way up to the island, an&rsquo;
I&rsquo;m sure as anything this here punt could slide right
up over it an&rsquo; never touch bottom. Are ye game to
try it, Miss Nann? Say, are ye?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl looked at the wide, flat shoal that was
about two feet under water and which was evidently
connected with the island. Then she looked at the
eager face of the boy. &ldquo;I dare, if you dare,&rdquo; she
said with a bright smile.</p>
<p>Gibralter managed to row the punt boat within a
length of the island over the submerged shoal, and
then it stuck.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; Nann remarked, &ldquo;I suppose we will have
to stay here until the rising tide lifts us off.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_100">[100]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Nary a bit of it,&rdquo; the boy replied as he stripped
off his shoes and stockings. This done he stepped
over the side of the boat, which, lightened of his
weight, again floated.</p>
<p>Taking the rope at the bow, the lad pulled and
tugged until the punt was high and dry, then Nann
leaped out. Standing on a rock, she shaded her eyes
and gazed back across the three miles of sparkling
blue waters. She could see the eight cottages in a
row on the sandy shore. How strange it seemed to
be looking at them from the island.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We mustn&rsquo;t stay long, Gib,&rdquo; she said to the lad
who was examining the rocks with interest. &ldquo;When
the tide rises the waves will be higher and that punt
boat of yours may not be very seaworthy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thar&rsquo;s nothin&rsquo; onusual on this here side,&rdquo; the
boy soon reported. &ldquo;&rsquo;Twon&rsquo;t take long to climb up
top and see what&rsquo;s on the other side.&rdquo; As he spoke,
he began to climb over the rocks, holding out his
hand to assist the sure-footed girl in the ascent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There doesn&rsquo;t seem to be a green thing growing
anywhere,&rdquo; Nann remarked as she looked about
curiously, &ldquo;even in the crevices there is nothing but
a silvery gray moss.&rdquo; Then she inquired, &ldquo;Are
there any serpents on this island, Gib?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boy shook his head. &ldquo;Never heard tell of
anything hereabouts, &rsquo;cept just an octopus. Pa says
onct a fisherman&rsquo;s boat was pulled under by one of
them critters with a lot of arms sort o&rsquo; like snakes.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_101">[101]</div>
<p>Nann stood still and stared at the boy. &ldquo;Gibralter
Strait,&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;if I thought there was one of
those terrible sea-serpents about here, I&rsquo;d go right
home this very instant. Why, I&rsquo;d rather meet a
dozen ghosts than one octopus.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess &rsquo;twant nothin&rsquo; but a story,&rdquo; the boy said,
sorry that he had happened to mention it. &ldquo;Guess
likely that was all.&rdquo; Then, as they had reached the
top of the rocks that were piled high, they stood for
a moment side by side gazing down to the rugged
shore far below.</p>
<p>The boy suddenly caught the girl&rsquo;s arm. &ldquo;Look!
<a id="rfront" href="#front">Look!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I was wantin&rsquo; to find.&rdquo;</a>
He pointed toward a whitening skeleton of
a boat that was high on the rocks well out of reach
of the surf and about two hundred feet to the left of
where they were standing. &ldquo;Like as not that wreck&rsquo;s
been thar nigh unto ten year, shouldn&rsquo;t you say?
An&rsquo; if so, why mightn&rsquo;t it be &lsquo;The Phantom Yacht&rsquo;
as well as any other? I should think it might,
shouldn&rsquo;t you, Miss Nann?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_102">[102]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose so,&rdquo; the girl faltered. &ldquo;But oh, how
I do hope that it isn&rsquo;t. I want to believe that the
mother with her boy and girl are safe, somewhere.&rdquo;
Then pleadingly, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think we&rsquo;d better start
for home now, Gib? I do want to get away before
the tide turns, and even if that old skeleton should
be &lsquo;The Phantom Yacht,&rsquo; there would be no way for
us to prove it. You never did know the real name
of the boat, did you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo; the boy confessed, &ldquo;I never did. Sort o&rsquo;
got to thinkin&rsquo; &lsquo;Phantom Yacht&rsquo; was its name, but
like&rsquo;s not &rsquo;twasn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The bleached skeleton of the boat was soon
reached and the lad, leaving Nann standing on a
broad flat rock, scrambled down nearer and began
searching for something that might identify it as
the craft which, many years before, had sailed, white
and graceful, to and fro in the sheltered waters of
the bay, and which had been called &ldquo;The Phantom
Yacht.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Half an hour passed, but search as he might, the
disappointed boy found nothing that could identify
the boat. The storms of many winters had stripped
it, leaving but a whitened skeleton and, before long,
even that would be broken up and washed on the
shore where the cottages were, to be gathered and
burned as driftwood.</p>
<p>It was with real regret that Gibralter at last left
the wrecked boat and returned to the side of the girl.
He found her gazing into the swirling green waters
beyond the rocks as though she were fascinated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What ye lookin&rsquo; at, Miss Nann?&rdquo; he inquired.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_103">[103]</div>
<p>She turned toward him, wide-eyed. &ldquo;Gib,&rdquo; she
said, &ldquo;I thought I saw that octopus you were telling
about. Look, there it is again! See it stretching
out a long brown arm.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boy laughed heartily. &ldquo;That thar&rsquo;s sea weeds,
Miss Nann,&rdquo; he chuckled, &ldquo;one o&rsquo; the long streamer
kind.&rdquo; Then he added, more seriously, &ldquo;We&rsquo;d better
scud &rsquo;long. &rsquo;Pears like the tide is turnin&rsquo;.&rdquo; Then
his optimistic self once again, &ldquo;All the better if it has
turned. It&rsquo;ll take us to Siquaw Point a scootin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When they reached the ridge of the island, the
boy looked regretfully back at the grim skeleton.
&ldquo;D&rsquo;ye know, Miss Nann,&rdquo; he remarked, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure
sartin that we&rsquo;re leavin&rsquo; without findin&rsquo; a clue that&rsquo;s
hidin&rsquo; thar waitin&rsquo; to be found. I&rsquo;m sure sartin
we are.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was a habit with the boy to repeat, perhaps for
the sake of emphasis.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wall,&rdquo; Nann declared, &ldquo;to be real honest, Gib,
I&rsquo;d heaps rather be standing on that sandy stretch of
beach over there where the cottages are than I would
to find any clue that the old skeleton may be concealing.&rdquo;
Then she laughed, as she accepted his
proffered assistance to descend the rocks. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
know why, but I feel as though something skeery is
about to happen. Maybe I&rsquo;m more imaginative on
water than I am on land.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They slid and scrambled down the rocks and were
nearing the bottom when an ejaculation of mingled
astonishment and dismay escaped from the boy.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_104">[104]</div>
<p>&ldquo;What is it, Gib?&rdquo; the girl asked anxiously. &ldquo;Has
the skeery something happened already?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The punt. &rsquo;Taint thar. The tide rose sooner&rsquo;n
I was countin&rsquo; on and like&rsquo;s not that boat o&rsquo; mine
is sailin&rsquo; out to sea.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For one panicky moment the girl stood very still,
her hand pressed on her heart. Then she recalled
something that her father once had said: &ldquo;When
danger threatens, keep a clear head. That will do
more than anything else to avert trouble.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boy, shading his eyes, was searching for the
escaped punt far out on the shining waters, but
Nann, looking about her, made a discovery. Then
she laughed gleefully. The boy turned toward her
in astonishment. Then, being very quick witted, he
too understood. &ldquo;You don&rsquo; need to tell me,&rdquo; he said,
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m on! We changed our location, so to speak,
when we went to look at the wreck, and that fetched
us down at a different place on this here side.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nann nodded. &ldquo;I do believe that we&rsquo;ll find the
punt beyond the rocks yonder,&rdquo; she hazarded. And
they did. Ten minutes later the boy had pushed the
boat safely over the submerged shoal. The rising
tide carried them swiftly out of danger of the hidden
rocks. Although Nann said nothing, she kept intently
gazing into the dark green water. She would
far rather meet any number of ghosts on land, she
assured herself, than even catch a glimpse of one of
those dreadful sea monsters.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_105">[105]</div>
<p>It was nearly one o&rsquo;clock when Dories, who was
standing on the porch of the cabin, saw the flat-bottomed
boat returning, and she ran down to the
shore to meet her friend.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you find a clue?&rdquo; she called as Nan leaped
ashore.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe so,&rdquo; was the merry response.
&ldquo;We found an old whitening skeleton of some ill-fated
boat, but I&rsquo;m not going to believe it is the
Phantom Yacht. Not yet, anyway.&rdquo; Then Nann
turned to call to the boy who was pushing his punt
away from the rocks, &ldquo;See you tomorrow, Gib, if
you come this way. Thank you for taking me
sailing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As soon as the girls had turned back toward the
cottage, Dories exclaimed, &ldquo;Nann, I believe that I
have thought of a splendid way to trap the ghost
tonight, but I&rsquo;m not going to tell you until just
before we go to bed.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_106">[106]</div>
<h2 id="c13"><br />CHAPTER XIII.
<br />BELLING THE GHOST</h2>
<p>There was a sharp, cold wind that afternoon and
so Nann suggested that they make a big fire on the
hearth in the living room and write letters. Miss
Moore had told them that she wished to be left
alone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have used up nearly all of the wood in the
shed,&rdquo; Nann said as she brought in an armful.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s lots of driftwood on the shore. Let&rsquo;s
gather some tomorrow,&rdquo; Dories suggested as she
made herself comfortable in a deep, easy willow
chair near the jolly blaze which Nann had started.
&ldquo;Now I&rsquo;m going to write the newsiest kind of a
letter to mother and brother. I suppose you&rsquo;ll write
to your father.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nann nodded as she seated herself on the other
side of the fireplace, pencil and pad in readiness.
For a few moments they scribbled, then Dories
glanced up to remark with a half shudder, &ldquo;Do hear
that mournful wind whistling down the chimney,
and here comes the fog drifting in so early. If it
weren&rsquo;t for the fire, this would be a gloomy afternoon.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_107">[107]</div>
<p>Again they wrote for a time, then Dories glanced
up to find Nann gazing thoughtfully into the fire.
&ldquo;A penny for your thoughts,&rdquo; she called.</p>
<p>Nann smiled brightly. &ldquo;They were rather a
jumble. I was wondering if, by any chance, you
and I would ever meet the wee girl and the handsome
little boy who sailed away on the Phantom
Yacht; then, too, I was wondering who was playing
a practical joke on us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Meaning what?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why the notes, of course.&rdquo; Nann folded her
finished letter, addressed the envelope and after
stamping it, she glanced up to ask, &ldquo;Why not tell me
now, how you intend to trap the joker.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean the spook. Well this is it. I found
a little bell today. One that Aunt Jane used, I suppose,
to call her maid in former years.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nann&rsquo;s merry laughter rang out. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve heard of
belling a cat,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;but never before did I hear
of belling a ghost.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dories smiled. &ldquo;Oh, I didn&rsquo;t mean that we were
to catch the&mdash;well, whoever it is that leaves the messages,
first, and then hang a bell on him. That, of
course, would be impossible.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, then, what is your plan?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_108">[108]</div>
<p>But before Dories could explain, a querulous voice
from the adjoining room called, &ldquo;Girls, its five
o&rsquo;clock! I do wish you would bring me my toast and
tea. The air is so chilly, I need it to warm me up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Contritely Dories sprang to the door. She had
entirely forgotten her aunt&rsquo;s existence all of the
afternoon. &ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t you like to have part of the
supper that Nann and I will prepare for ourselves?&rdquo;
she asked. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have anything that you would
like.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Toast and tea are all I wish, and I want them at
once,&rdquo; was the rather ungracious reply. And so the
girls went to the kitchen, made a fire in the stove
and set the kettle on to boil.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Goodness, I&rsquo;d hate to have nothing to eat but
tea and toast day in and day out,&rdquo; was Dories&rsquo; comment.
Then to her companion, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s your turn to
choose from the cupboard tonight and plan the
supper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, and I&rsquo;ll get it, too, while you wait on
Miss Moore.&rdquo;</p>
<p>An hour later the girls had finished the really excellent
meal which Nann had prepared, and, for a
while, they sat close to the kitchen stove to keep
warm. The wind, which had been moaning all of
the afternoon about the cabin, had risen in velocity
and Dories remarked with a shudder that it might
be the start of one of those dismal three-day storms
about which Gib had told them.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_109">[109]</div>
<p>&ldquo;It may be as terrible as that hurricane that swept
the sea up over the wall and undermined old Colonel
Wadbury&rsquo;s house,&rdquo; she continued, bent, it would
seem, on having the picture as dark as she could.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t it be great?&rdquo; Nann smiled provokingly.
&ldquo;You ought to be glad, for surely the spook that
carries the lantern down on the point will be blown
away.&rdquo; Then, chancing to recall something, she
asked, &ldquo;But you haven&rsquo;t told me your plan yet. How
are you going to bell the ghost?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My plan is to hang a little bell on the knob after
we have locked our door. Then, of course, if we have
a midnight visitor, he won&rsquo;t be able to enter without
ringing the bell,&rdquo; Dories explained.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poor Aunt Jane, if it does ring,&rdquo; Nann remarked.
&ldquo;How frightened she will be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dories drew her knees up and folded her arms
about them. &ldquo;Well, I do believe that we would be
most scared of all,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then why do it?&rdquo; This merrily from Nann.
&ldquo;And, what&rsquo;s more, if it is a ghost, it will be able to
slip into our room without awakening us. Whoever
heard of a ghost having to stop to unlock a door?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe not,&rdquo; Dories agreed, &ldquo;but if we are going
to have any real enjoyment during our stay in this
cabin, we must frighten away the ghost that seems
to haunt it. I think my plan is an excellent one and,
at least, I&rsquo;d like to try it.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_110">[110]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Very well, maiden fair.&rdquo; Nann rose as she
spoke. &ldquo;On your head be the result. Now, shall
we ascend to our chamber?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Taking the lantern, she led the way, and Dories
followed, carrying a small bell. When the loft room
was reached the lantern was placed on a table. Nann
carefully locked the door and, removing the key, she
placed it by the lamp.</p>
<p>Then she held the small bell while Dories tied it
to the knob. This done, they hastily undressed and
hopped into bed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s leave the light burning all night so that we
may watch the bell,&rdquo; the more timid maiden suggested.</p>
<p>How her companion laughed. &ldquo;Why watch
it?&rdquo; she inquired. &ldquo;We surely will be able to hear
it in the dark if it rings. There is very little oil left
in the lantern, so we&rsquo;d better put the light out now,
and then, if along about midnight we hear the bell
ringing, we can relight it and see who our visitor
may be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nann Sibbett, I&rsquo;m almost inclined to think that
you write those messages yourself, just to tease me,
for you don&rsquo;t seem to be the least bit afraid.&rdquo; This
accusingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Honest, Injun, I don&rsquo;t write them!&rdquo; Nann said
with sudden seriousness. &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t the slightest
idea where the messages come from, but I do know
that whoever leaves them does not mean harm to us,
so why be afraid? Now cuddle down, for I&rsquo;m going
to blow out the light.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_111">[111]</div>
<p>Dories ducked under the quilt and, a moment
later, when she ventured to peer out, she found the
room in complete darkness, for, as usual, a heavy
fog shut out the light of the stars.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How long do you suppose it will be before the
bell rings?&rdquo; she whispered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m not going to stay awake to listen,&rdquo;
Nann replied, but she had not slept long when she
was suddenly awakened by her companion, who was
clutching her arm. &ldquo;Did you hear that noise? What
was it? Didn&rsquo;t it sound like a faint tinkle?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The two girls sat up in bed and stared at the door.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_112">[112]</div>
<h2 id="c14"><br />CHAPTER XIV.
<br />A PUNT RIDE</h2>
<p>The faint tinkle sounded again. Nann sprang
up and lighted the lantern. To her amazement the
bell was gone. Surprised as she was, she had sufficient
presence of mind not to tell her timid companion
what had happened. Very softly she turned
the knob. The door was still locked. She glanced
at the window; the blind was still hooked. Then,
blowing out the light, she said in a tone meant to
express unconcern, &ldquo;All is serene on the Potomac
as far as I can see.&rdquo; After returning to bed, however,
Nann remained awake, long after her companion&rsquo;s
even breathing told that she was asleep,
wondering what it could all mean. Toward morning
Nann fell into a light slumber, from which she was
awakened by the sun streaming into the room. Sitting
up, she saw that Dories was dressed and had
opened the blinds. For a moment she sat in a dazed
puzzling. What was it that she had been pondering
about in the night? Remembering suddenly, she
glanced quickly at the door. There hung the little
bell as quietly as though it had never disappeared.
Dories, hearing a movement, turned from the window
where she had been gazing out at the sparkling
sea.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_113">[113]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Good morning to you, Nancy dear,&rdquo; she said
gaily. &ldquo;O, such a lovely day this is! How I hope
that I may go sailing with you and Gib.&rdquo; Then, as
she saw her friend continuing to stare at the bell as
though fascinated, Dories remarked, &ldquo;Well, I guess
the ghost took warning all right and stayed away.
We won&rsquo;t find a little paper in our room this morning,
I&rsquo;ll wager.&rdquo; As she talked, she was crossing
the room to the door. Lifting the little bell, she
dropped it again with a clang.</p>
<p>Nann sprang out of bed, all excited interest.
&ldquo;Dories, what happened? Why did you drop the
bell?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dories pointed to the floor where it lay. Nann
bent to pick it up. Tied to the clapper was a bit of
paper and on it was written in the familiar penmanship
and with the same red ink, &ldquo;In eleven days you
will know all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Instead of acting frightened, Dories&rsquo; look was
one of triumph. &ldquo;There now, Mistress Nann,&rdquo; she
exclaimed, &ldquo;you are always saying that it is not a
being supernatural that is leaving these notes. What
have you to say about it this morning?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_114">[114]</div>
<p>&ldquo;That I am truly puzzled,&rdquo; was the confession
Nann was forced to make; &ldquo;that the joker is much
too clever for us, but we&rsquo;ll catch him yet, if I&rsquo;m a
prophet.&rdquo; She was dressing as she talked.</p>
<p>Dories, standing near the window, was examining
the paper. &ldquo;It seems to be the sort that packages
are wrapped in,&rdquo; she speculated. Then, after a silent
moment and a closer scrutiny, &ldquo;Nann, do you suppose
that it is written with blood?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good gracious, no!&rdquo; the denial was emphatic.
&ldquo;Why do you ask such an absurd question?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, that was what the red ink was made of in
one of the ghost stories that I read to Aunt Jane
yesterday morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nann, having completed her toilet, went to the
window to look out. &ldquo;Good!&rdquo; she exclaimed.
&ldquo;There is Gibralter Strait in his little punt boat.
He seems to have plenty of time to go sailing. Oh,
I remember now. He did tell me that their country
school does not open until after Christmas. So many
boys are needed to help their fathers on the farms
and with the cranberries until snow falls.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose I ought to stay at home again this
morning and read to Aunt Jane.&rdquo; Dories&rsquo; voice
sounded so doleful that her friend whirled about,
and, putting loving arms about her, she exclaimed:
&ldquo;Not a bit of it! You may sail with Gibralter this
morning and I will stay here and read to your Great-Aunt
Jane.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_115">[115]</div>
<p>But when the two girls visited the room of the
elderly woman, she told them that she wished to be
left quite alone.</p>
<p>Dories went to the bedside and, almost timidly,
she touched the wrinkled head. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you feel well
today, Aunt Jane!&rdquo; she asked, feeling in her heart
a sudden pity for the old woman. &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t there something
I could do for you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>For one fleeting moment there was that strange
expression in the dark, deeply-sunken eyes. It might
have been a hungry yearning for love and affection.
Impulsively the girl kissed the sallow cheek, but the
elderly woman had closed her eyes and she did not
open them again, and so Nann and Dories tiptoed
out to the kitchen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poor Aunt Jane!&rdquo; the latter began. &ldquo;She hasn&rsquo;t
had much love in her life. I don&rsquo;t remember just
how it was. She was engaged to marry somebody
once. Then something happened and she didn&rsquo;t.
After that, Mother says she just shut herself up in
that fine home of hers outside of Boston and
grieved.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_116">[116]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Poor Aunt Jane, indeed!&rdquo; Nann commented as
she began to prepare the breakfast. &ldquo;She must be
haunted by many of the ghosts that your mother
told about, memories of loving deeds that she might
have done. With her money and her home, she
could have made many people happy, but instead she
has spent her life just being sorry for herself.&rdquo;
Then more brightly, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad we can both go sailing
with Gib.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Half an hour later, the girls in their bright colored
sweater-coats and tams raced across the beach. The
red-headed boy was on the watch for them and he
soon had the punt alongside the broad rock which
served as a dock. &ldquo;Do you want passengers this
morning?&rdquo; Nann called gaily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure sartin!&rdquo; was the prompt reply. Then, when
the two girls were seated on the broad seat in the
stem the lad hauled in the sheet and away they went
scudding. &ldquo;Where are you going, Gib?&rdquo; Nann
inquired curiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll cruise &rsquo;long the water side o&rsquo; the ol&rsquo; ruin,&rdquo;
he told them. &ldquo;Pa says he&rsquo;s sure sartin he saw a
light burnin&rsquo; thar agin late las&rsquo; night, an&rsquo; like&rsquo;s not,
we&rsquo;ll see suthin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_117">[117]</div>
<h2 id="c15"><br />CHAPTER XV.
<br />A GLOOMY SWAMP</h2>
<p>The girls were as eager as the boy to view the old
ruin from the water, and the breeze being brisk, they
were quickly blown down the coast and into the quiet
sheltered water beyond the point. &ldquo;O, Gib,&rdquo; Dories
cried fearfully, &ldquo;do be careful! There are logs
under the water along here that come nearly to the
top. Is it a wreck?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, &rsquo;taint. It&rsquo;s all that&rsquo;s left of the long dock
I was tellin&rsquo; yo&rsquo; about whar the Phantom Yacht
used to tie up. Pa said ol&rsquo; Colonel Wadbury had
lights clear to the end of it and that, when &rsquo;twas lit
up, &rsquo;twas a purty sight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It must have been,&rdquo; Nann agreed. Then Dories
inquired: &ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t it make you feel strange to
realize that you are on the very spot where the Phantom
Yacht once sailed?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And where some day it may sail again,&rdquo; Nann
completed.</p>
<p>The high rocky point cut off the wind and so Gib
let the sail flap as they slowly drifted toward the
swamp.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_118">[118]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Thar&rsquo;s all that&rsquo;s left of that sea wall I was tellin&rsquo;
about,&rdquo; the boy nodded at huge rocks half sunken
in mire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The reeds are higher than our heads,&rdquo; Dories
commented; then she asked, &ldquo;Is there a path through
the marsh, do you think, Gib?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I&rsquo;m <i>sure</i> thar ain&rsquo;t one,&rdquo; the boy declared.
&ldquo;Me&rsquo;n Dick Burton would have found it if thar had
been. We&rsquo;ve looked times enough from the land
side. We never could get here by water, bein&rsquo; as
we didn&rsquo;t have a boat. That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;ve been savin&rsquo;
to get a punt. Dick, he put in some toward it, an&rsquo;
so its half his&rsquo;n.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who is Dick Burton?&rdquo; Nann inquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t I tell you?&rdquo; Gib seemed surprised. &ldquo;Sort
o&rsquo; thought o&rsquo; course you knew &rsquo;bout the Burtons.
Dick&rsquo;s folks own the cabin that&rsquo;s nearest the rocks.
He&rsquo;s a city feller &rsquo;bout my age, or a leetle older, I
reckon. He&rsquo;s been comin&rsquo; to these parts ever since
we was shavers. You&rsquo;d ought to know him,&rdquo; this
to Nann, &ldquo;he lives in Boston, whar you come from.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl addressed laughed good-naturedly. &ldquo;Gib,&rdquo;
she queried, &ldquo;have you ever been up to Boston?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boy reluctantly confessed that he had not.
Then the girl explained that since it was much
larger than Siquaw Center, two people might live
there forever and not become acquainted.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_119">[119]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yeah.&rdquo; Gib had evidently not been listening to
the last part of Nann&rsquo;s remark. &ldquo;I do wish Dick
was here now that we&rsquo;ve got the punt,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I
sure sartin wish he was.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; Dories inquired as she let one hand drift
in the cool water.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wall, me&rsquo;n he allays thought maybe thar was a
channel through the swamp up toward the old ruin.
If he was here we&rsquo;d set out to find it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But why can&rsquo;t Dori and I help you as much as
he could?&rdquo; Nann queried. &ldquo;I believe you are right,
Gib,&rdquo; she continued before the boy had time to reply.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve seen swamps before, and there was always a
narrow channel through them where the tide washed
when it was high. See ahead there, where the swamp
comes down to the water&rsquo;s edge, I wish you&rsquo;d take
the sail down, Gib, and row as close to it as you
can.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boy looked his amazement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, I say, Miss Nann, like&rsquo;s not we&rsquo;d hit a
snag, like&rsquo;s not we would.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s skeered now?&rdquo; the girl taunted. The boy
flushed. &ldquo;Not me!&rdquo; he protested, and taking down
the sail he rowed along the water side of the dense
reedy growths. &ldquo;Yo&rsquo; see thar&rsquo;s nothin&rsquo;,&rdquo; he began
when Nann, leaning forward, pointed as she cried
excitedly, &ldquo;There it is! There&rsquo;s an opening in the
swamp leading right up to that haunted house.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_120">[120]</div>
<p>Nann was right. A narrow channel of clear
water appeared among the reeds that were higher
than their heads. It led toward the middle of the
marsh and was wide enough for a larger boat than
theirs to pass through.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, the next question is, do we dare go in?&rdquo;
Nann was gleeful over her find and how she wished
that Gib&rsquo;s friend, Dick Burton, were there to share
with them that exciting moment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, that question is easy to answer,&rdquo; Dories
hastened to say. &ldquo;We most certainly do not dare.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boy, having removed his nondescript cap, was
scratching his ear in a way that he always did when
puzzled. Then there was a sudden eager light in his
red-brown eyes. Replacing his hat, he seized the
oars and began to row rapidly back up the shore and
toward the row of eight cottages.</p>
<p>Nann was puzzled and voiced her curiosity. &ldquo;Got
to get back to Siquaw in time for the ten-ten train,&rdquo;
was all the information she received.</p>
<p>Since he had said nothing of this when they
started out, and had seemed to be in no hurry whatever,
Nann naturally wondered about it.</p>
<p>Some light might have been thrown on his action
had she seen him, one hour later, as he sat on the
high stool at his father&rsquo;s desk in the general store.
He was painstakingly writing, and, when the ten-ten
train arrived, Gibralter Strait was on the platform
waiting to send to the nearby city of Boston the
very first letter that he had ever written.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_121">[121]</div>
<h2 id="c16"><br />CHAPTER XVI.
<br />OUT IN THE DARK</h2>
<p>All the next day the girls waited and watched,
but Gibralter Strait appeared neither on land nor on
sea to explain his queer actions. Their hostess asked
Dories to read to her and so the morning was passed
in that way. Nann, busy at a piece of fancy work
she was making for a Christmas present, sat listening.
In the afternoon the girls were told to amuse
themselves. This they did by climbing to the &ldquo;tip-top
rock,&rdquo; sitting there in the balmy sun and speculating
about the old ruin; about the reason for Gib&rsquo;s
sudden departure for his home the day before, and
about the boy and girl who had sailed away on the
Phantom Yacht. It was not until a fog, filmy at
first, but rapidly increasing in density, began to hide
the sun that they thought of returning homewards.
As they passed the cabin nearest the rocks, Dories
said, &ldquo;This is the Burton cottage, I suppose. I wonder
if Dick is our kind of boy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Meaning what?&rdquo; Nann wondered.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_122">[122]</div>
<p>&ldquo;O, you know as well as I do. I like Gib, of
course. He&rsquo;s a splendid boy, but he hasn&rsquo;t had a
chance. I merely meant a boy from families like
our own.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I rather think so,&rdquo; Nann replied, as she gazed
at the boarded-up cabin. Then suddenly she stopped
and stared at one of the upper windows. The blind
had opened ever so slightly and then had closed
again, but of this Nann said nothing. She was
afraid that she was becoming almost as imaginative
as Dories. Then suddenly she recalled something.
Gib had said that his father had seen a light in the
old ruin the night before. And what was more, she
and Dories <i>knew</i> there had been someone carrying a
lantern on the beach near the rocks at least twice
since they had been there. What if the lantern-carrier
hid in the Burton cottage during the day?
He couldn&rsquo;t live in the old ruin, since it had only
one wall standing.</p>
<p>Luckily, Dories had been interested in watching
the waves breaking at her feet. Turning, she called,
&ldquo;O, but it&rsquo;s getting cold and damp. Let&rsquo;s run the
rest of the way.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_123">[123]</div>
<p>When they reached their home cabin, Nann went
at once to inquire if Miss Moore wished her supper.
The girl was sure that she heard a scurrying noise
in the old woman&rsquo;s room. The door was closed and
there was silence for a brief moment before she was
told to enter. Puzzled, Nann glanced quickly at the
bed and noted that the old woman&rsquo;s cap was awry.
She also saw something else that puzzled her, but she
merely said, &ldquo;What would you like tonight with
your tea, Miss Moore?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing at all but toast, and tell Dories to be
sure it doesn&rsquo;t burn. I don&rsquo;t relish it when it has
been scraped.&rdquo; The tone in which this was said was
impatient and fretful. It was evident that the old
woman was not in as pleasant a mood as she had
seemed to be in the morning.</p>
<p>Returning to the kitchen, where the kettle was
already boiling, Nann made the tea and toasted the
bread as well as she could over the blaze; then Dories
arranged her aunt&rsquo;s tray attractively and took it in to
her. While she was gone, Nann stood staring out
of the window at the gathering dusk. She believed
she had a clue to one of the mysteries surrounding
them, but decided not to tell her friend until she was
a little more certain about it herself.</p>
<p>When Dories returned to the kitchen she said,
&ldquo;Day-dreaming, Nann?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, dusk-dreaming,&rdquo; was the smiling reply;
then, &ldquo;Now let&rsquo;s get our evening repast. What shall
it be?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_124">[124]</div>
<p>Together they looked in the closet, each selecting
a canned vegetable and something for desert. &ldquo;This
is a lazy way to live,&rdquo; Nann began, when Dories
exclaimed: &ldquo;Do you realize that we haven&rsquo;t had one
of those notes today? I believe my bell scared away
the ghost after all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nann laughed merrily. &ldquo;Nary a bit of it, my
friend. Didn&rsquo;t his spooky highness tie his last note
to the bell clapper? I suppose that is why we didn&rsquo;t
hear it tinkle again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But we haven&rsquo;t found a note today&mdash;O dear!&rdquo;
Dories broke off to exclaim: &ldquo;The fire must be going
out, Nann,&rdquo; she called; &ldquo;you&rsquo;re the magician when
it comes to stirring up a blaze. What do you suppose
is the matter?&rdquo;</p>
<p>A quick glance within brought the amused answer:
&ldquo;Wood needed, my dear, that&rsquo;s all! Which
reminds me of Dad&rsquo;s wondering why the car won&rsquo;t
go when it&rsquo;s out of gas.&rdquo; As she spoke she turned
toward the wood box and found it empty. &ldquo;Hmm!&rdquo;
she ejaculated, &ldquo;that means one of us will have to
hie out to the shed after more wood if we want a
hot supper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dories, after a swift glance at the black fog-hung
window, suggested, &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s change our menu and
have a cold spread.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nixy, my dear,&rdquo; Nann said brightly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be
wood-carrier. I&rsquo;ll sally forth with a lighted lantern,
like that mysterious midnight prowler. I won&rsquo;t be
able to bring in much wood, but I believe a piece or
two will provide all the heat we&rsquo;ll need to warm up
canned things.&rdquo; She was lighting the lantern as she
talked. The lamp was burning on the kitchen table,
and, while her friend was gone, Dories laid out the
dishes and silver.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_125">[125]</div>
<p>Nann, having reached the shed, groped about for
the leather thong. To her surprise the door was not
fastened, and, as she stood peering into the dense
blackness, she was sure that she heard a scrambling
noise inside. Then all was still. Nann scratched
one of the matches that she had brought with her.
In the far corner stood an empty barrel and in front
of it was piled the wood that she and Dories had
gathered on the beach. Not another thing was to be
seen, and although she stood listening intently for
several seconds, not another sound was heard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A rat probably,&rdquo; the girl thought as she placed
her lantern on the floor and picked up several pieces
of wood.</p>
<p>Returning to the kitchen, Nann threw her armful
of wood into the box near the stove, when Dories
suddenly leaped forward, exclaiming excitedly,
&ldquo;There it is. There&rsquo;s the note we have been wondering
about.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_126">[126]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Why&mdash;why, so it is!&rdquo; Nann stared as though
she could hardly believe her eyes. Then, springing
up, she cried joyfully: &ldquo;Dories Moore, we&rsquo;ve caught
the ghost. He was leaving this paper when I went
out. He must still be in the woodshed somewhere,
for I bolted the door on the outside. He must have
been hiding in that old empty barrel when I looked
in. Light the lantern again and let&rsquo;s go out this
minute and see who is there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Although Dories was not enthusiastic over the
prospect of capturing a ghost in a woodshed on so
dark a fog-damp night, yet, since her companion
was ready to start, she couldn&rsquo;t refuse to accompany
her, and so, after closing the kitchen door, they stole
along the path leading from the porch to the shed
that was nearer the swamp. Suddenly Dories
clutched her friend&rsquo;s arm, whispering, &ldquo;Hark.
What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the ghost. He&rsquo;s still in there.&rdquo; This triumphantly
from Nann, the fearless. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the
same scrambling noise that I heard before. Come
on. Don&rsquo;t be afraid. I&rsquo;ll throw open the door and
at least we&rsquo;ll see who it is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Leaping forward, Nann unbolted the door and
held up the lantern. The shed was as empty as it
had been before, and there was nothing at all in the
barrel.</p>
<p>Dories&rsquo; sigh was one of relief, and she fairly
darted back to the warm kitchen, nor did she breathe
naturally until the outer door was bolted. Then
Nann inquired, &ldquo;What did the note say. We forgot
to read it?&rdquo; Stooping, she took it from under
a splinter of wood and, opening it, read: &ldquo;In ten
days you will know all.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_127">[127]</div>
<h2 id="c17"><br />CHAPTER XVII.
<br />MORE MYSTERIES</h2>
<p>Long after Dories slept that night Nann lay
awake thinking of the several mysteries surrounding
them. Who was leaving the notes in places
where the girls could not help finding them; who
was carrying a lantern on the rocky point at night;
was it the same light that was seen in the old ruin
by people living in Siquaw Center, and why had the
blind in the Burton cottage opened ever so little and
then closed again as though someone had peered out
at them for a brief moment? It was indeed puzzling.
Could it possibly have anything to do with
the Phantom Yacht? Nann decided that was impossible.
At last she fell asleep. When she awakened
it was nearly dawn. The fog had drifted away,
the stars shone out and the full moon made it as
light as day.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_128">[128]</div>
<p>Nann, the fearless, decided to dress and go out
on the sand and look at the Burton cottage. She
was nearly dressed before she realized that if Dories
woke and found her gone, she might scream out in
her fright and waken the old woman, and so she
shook her gently, whispering her plan. Dories&rsquo; eyes
showed her terror at being left alone. She got up
at once. &ldquo;I simply will not stay in this haunted
loft,&rdquo; she declared vehemently. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going with
you.&rdquo; As it was still dark they took the lighted
lantern with them, but when they reached the back
porch, Nann whispered that they would have to put
out the light as they would be seen if, indeed, there
was anyone to see them. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll take it, though. I
have matches in my pocket. We&rsquo;ll light it if we
need it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dories clung to her friend&rsquo;s hand as Nann led the
way back of the row of boarded-up cottages. When
they reached the seventh, Dories suddenly drew back
and whispered, &ldquo;Nann, why are we doing this?
What are you expecting to see? I&rsquo;m simply scared
to death.&rdquo; Her companion realized that this was
true, since Dories&rsquo; teeth were chattering. Self-rebukingly,
she said, &ldquo;O, I ought not have brought
you. In fact, I probably shouldn&rsquo;t have come myself,
but I am so eager to solve at least one of the
mysteries that surround us.&rdquo; Then she told how
she had been sure that she had seen a blind open
ever so slightly and close late the afternoon before
as though someone had been watching them. &ldquo;I
thought if someone goes every night to the old ruin
and returns to the Burton cottage to hide during the
day, he probably comes just about this hour, and that
if we were watching, we might at least see what
the&mdash;the&mdash;well&mdash;whoever it is&mdash;looks like.&rdquo; They
had crouched down in the shadow of the seventh
cottage as Nann made this explanation.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_129">[129]</div>
<p>Slowly the darkness lightened, the stars and moon
dimmed and the east became gray; then rosy, but
still there had been no sign of anyone entering the
Burton cabin. Nann had been sure that an entrance
could not be made in the front of the cottage as the
lower windows and door on that side were securely
boarded up. The back door was not boarded, and
so that was where she was watching.</p>
<p>An hour dragged slowly by. The sun rose and
was well on its apparent upward way, and still no
one appeared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think that maybe you imagined it all?&rdquo;
Dories inquired at length as she tried to change her
position, having become stiffened from crouching
so long.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, no, I am sure that I didn&rsquo;t.&rdquo; Then, fearless
as usual, Nann announced, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going up to the
back porch and try the door.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This she did, and to her surprise it opened, creaking
noisily as it swung on rusty hinges.</p>
<p>Dories leaped to her side. &ldquo;Gracious, Nann, are
you going in?&rdquo; she whispered tragically. &ldquo;If anyone
is in there, he might lock us in or something.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_130">[130]</div>
<p>Nann turned to reply, but instead she exclaimed:
&ldquo;Why, Dories Moore, you&rsquo;re whiter than any sheet
I ever saw. If you&rsquo;re that scared, we&rsquo;d better go
right home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am!&rdquo; Dories nodded miserably. &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t
any more dare go into this cottage than&mdash;than&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then we won&rsquo;t.&rdquo; Nann took her friend by the
hand and together they went down the back steps,
and Dories said: &ldquo;I&rsquo;d rather go home by the front
beach if you don&rsquo;t mind. It&rsquo;s more open. There&rsquo;s
something so uncanny about the swamps at the
back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anything to please,&rdquo; was the laughing reply. As
they rounded the cottage, Nann looked curiously at
the upper windows, and was sure that she saw the
same blind open ever so little, then close again. She
said nothing of this, and tried to change the trend
of her companion&rsquo;s thoughts by talking about Gibralter
Strait and wondering if they would see him
during that day which had just dawned. Nann was
deciding that she would take Gib into her confidence.
A boy as fearless as he was would not mind entering
the Burton cottage and finding out why that
upper blind had opened and closed as it seemed to do.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_131">[131]</div>
<p>As they neared their home cabin, Dories became
more like her natural self and even skipped along
the hard beach, laughing back at Nann as she called,
&ldquo;Another glorious, sparkling day! I hope something
interesting is going to happen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe something will,&rdquo; Nann replied. They
were nearing the front steps when Dories stood still,
pointing, &ldquo;Look at that stone lying in the middle
of the top step. How do you suppose it ever got
there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nann shook her head and, leaping up the steps,
she lifted the small rock, then turned back, exclaiming:
&ldquo;Just what I thought! Here is today&rsquo;s note
from your ghost. It&rsquo;s much too clever for us.&rdquo; Then
she read: &ldquo;In nine days you shall know all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Not wishing to awaken Miss Moore at so early
an hour, the girls tiptoed down the steps and went
around to the back of the cabin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s look in the woodshed by daylight,&rdquo; Nann
suggested as she unbolted the door. &ldquo;Nothing
within, just as I supposed,&rdquo; she remarked. &ldquo;Humm-ho.
We&rsquo;re not very good detectives, I guess.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They started walking toward the kitchen. &ldquo;But
why try to find out what the mysteries are about if
every day brings us one nearer to the time when we
are to know all?&rdquo; Dories inquired.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_132">[132]</div>
<p>Nann laughed. &ldquo;O, I&rsquo;d heaps rather ferret the
thing out for myself than be told.&rdquo; Then she said
more seriously: &ldquo;Honestly, Dori, I don&rsquo;t think the
notes refer to the mystery of the old ruin at all. I
think, if that is ever solved, we&rsquo;ll have to find it out
for ourselves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why do you think that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d rather not tell quite yet.&rdquo; They entered the
kitchen. &ldquo;Now,&rdquo; Nann said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to make a
fire and get breakfast. We&rsquo;ve been up so long that
I&rsquo;m ravenously hungry. I&rsquo;m going to make flapjacks
no less.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good!&rdquo; Dories replied. &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t refuse to eat
them.&rdquo; Although consumed with curiosity concerning
what her friend had said, Dories decided to bide
her time before asking Nann to explain.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_133">[133]</div>
<h2 id="c18"><br />CHAPTER XVIII.
<br />AN AIRPLANE SIGHTED</h2>
<p>Miss Moore did not awaken, apparently, until
midmorning and the girls did not want to go away
until they had served her breakfast. They had been
to her door several times and to all appearances the
elderly woman had been asleep. When, at length,
Miss Moore did awaken, she complained of having
been disturbed by noises in the night. &ldquo;Why did
you girls tiptoe around the living-room just before
daybreak?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, we didn&rsquo;t, Aunt Jane! Truly we didn&rsquo;t,&rdquo;
Dories replied. She did not like to tell that it would
have been a physical impossibility for them to have
done so, as they were crouched behind &ldquo;cabin seven&rdquo;
at that hour watching &ldquo;cabin eight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old woman looked at the speaker sharply,
then continued: &ldquo;I called your name and for a time
the tiptoeing stopped. Then, when I pretended to be
asleep, it began again. I was sure that under the
crack of the door I could see a fire burning as though
you had lighted wood on the grate.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_134">[134]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no, Miss Moore, we didn&rsquo;t, I assure you,&rdquo;
Nann exclaimed. &ldquo;There wasn&rsquo;t any wood on it.
We swept it clean yesterday afternoon.&rdquo; A cry
from Dories caused the speaker to pause and turn
toward her. She was pointing at the fireplace. There
was a small charred pile in the center of the grate.
The old woman&rsquo;s thoughts had evidently changed
their direction for she asked, querulously, if they
were going to keep her waiting all the morning for
her breakfast.</p>
<p>While out in the kitchen preparing it, Dories whispered,
her eyes wide, &ldquo;Nann, <i>what</i> do you make of
it all? You are smiling to yourself as if you had
solved the mystery.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe I have, one of them; but, Dori, please
don&rsquo;t ask me to explain until I catch the ghost red-handed,
so to speak.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;White-handed, shouldn&rsquo;t it be?&rdquo; Dories inquired,
her fears lessened by Nann&rsquo;s evident delight in something
she believed she had discovered.</p>
<p>When Miss Moore&rsquo;s breakfast had been served,
the girls, wishing to tidy up the cabin, set to work
with a will. Nann was sweeping the porch and
Dories was dusting and straightening the living-room
when a queer humming noise was heard in the
distance. &ldquo;Dori,&rdquo; Nann called, &ldquo;come out here a
moment. Can&rsquo;t you hear a strange buzzing noise?
It sounds as though it were high up in the air. What
can it be?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_135">[135]</div>
<p>The other girl appeared in the open doorway and
they both listened intently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe it&rsquo;s a flock of geese going south for the
winter,&rdquo; Dories ventured, but her friend shook her
head. &ldquo;That noise is coming nearer. Not going
farther away,&rdquo; she said. The buzzing and whizzing
sounds increased with great rapidity. Springing
down the steps, Nann exclaimed, &ldquo;Whatever is making
that commotion, is now right over our heads.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dories bounded to her friend&rsquo;s side and they both
gazed into the gleaming blue sky with shaded eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There it is!&rdquo; Nann cried excitedly. &ldquo;Why, of
course, it&rsquo;s an airplane! We should have guessed
that right away. I wonder where it is going to land.
There&rsquo;s nothing but marsh and water around here
besides this narrow strip of beach.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, look! look!&rdquo; This from Dories. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s dropping
right down into the ocean and so it must be one
of those combination air and sea planes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Unless it has broken a wing and is falling,&rdquo;
Nann suggested. The airplane, nose downward,
had seemed verily to plunge into the sea.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_136">[136]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s run to the Point o&rsquo; Rocks.&rdquo; Dories started
as she spoke and Nann, throwing down the broom,
raced after her. It was hard to go very rapidly
where the sand was deep and dry, and so by the
time they had climbed up on the highest boulder out
on the rocky point, there was no sign whatever of
the airplane either sailing safely on the water nor
lying on the shore disabled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hmm! That certainly is puzzling,&rdquo; Nann said
as she half closed her eyes in meditative thought.
&ldquo;Now, where can that huge thing have gone that it
has disappeared so entirely?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t imagine,&rdquo; Dories replied. &ldquo;If only
Gibralter were here with his punt, we might be able
to find out.&rdquo; Then she exclaimed merrily, &ldquo;Nann,
there is another mystery added to the twenty and
nine that we already have.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not quite that many,&rdquo; the other maid replied,
giving one last long look in the direction they
believed the plane had descended or fallen. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
inclined to think,&rdquo; she ventured, &ldquo;that there is a bay
or something beyond the swamp. O, well, let&rsquo;s go
back to our task. It&rsquo;s lunch time, if nothing else.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They decided, as the day was unusually warm for
that time of the year, to eat a cold lunch, and, as
their aunt did not wish anything then, the girls decided
to walk along the beach in the opposite direction
and see if they could find the cove where Gib
kept his punt in hiding. But, just as they reached
the spot where the road from town ended at the
beach, they heard a merry hallooing, and, turning,
they beheld Gibralter Strait riding the white horse
that was usually hitched to the coach.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_137">[137]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, good, good!&rdquo; was Dories&rsquo; delighted exclamation.
&ldquo;Now perhaps we will find out about
the plane. Of course the people in town saw it and
Gib may know&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; She stopped talking to stare
at the approaching steed and rider in wide-eyed
amazement. &ldquo;How queer!&rdquo; she ejaculated. &ldquo;Nann,
am I seeing double? I&rsquo;m sure that I see four legs
and Gib certainly has only two.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There were undeniably four long, slim legs, two
on either side of the big white horse, but the mystery
was quickly explained by the appearance, over
Gib&rsquo;s shoulder, of a head belonging to another boy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nann Sibbett!&rdquo; Dories whirled, the light of
inspiration in her eyes, &ldquo;I do believe that other boy
is Dick Burton, of whom Gib has so often spoken.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And Dories was right. Gib waved his cap, then
leaped to the sand, closely followed by the newcomer.
One glance at the young stranger assured the girls
that he was a city lad. His merry brown eyes twinkled
when Gibralter introduced him merely as the
&ldquo;kid that was crazy to find a way into the old ruin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The city boy took off his cap in a manner most
polite, adding, &ldquo;By name, Richard Ralston Burton,
but I&rsquo;m usually called Dick.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_138">[138]</div>
<p>Nann, realizing that Gib hadn&rsquo;t the remotest idea
how to introduce his friend to them, then told the
lad their names, adding, &ldquo;Oh, Gib, you just can&rsquo;t
guess how glad we are that you have come at last.
The mysteries are heaping up so high and fast that
we simply must solve a few of them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But it was quite evident that the boys were
equally excited about the airplane, which they, too,
had seen as they were riding on the white horse
along the road in the swamps. &ldquo;I say,&rdquo; Gib began
at once, &ldquo;did yo&rsquo;uns see where that airplane fellow
dove to? D&rsquo;you &rsquo;spose he&rsquo;s smashed all to smithereens
on the rocks over yonder?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girls shook their heads. &ldquo;No,&rdquo; Dories replied,
&ldquo;we just came from there and there wasn&rsquo;t a
sign of that airplane. We thought that at least we
would see the wreck of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It must o&rsquo; landed round the curve whar the
swamp comes down to the shore,&rdquo; Gib said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on, old man, let&rsquo;s investigate.&rdquo; Then Dick
smiled directly at Nann as he added, &ldquo;We won&rsquo;t be
gone long.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_139">[139]</div>
<h2 id="c19"><br />CHAPTER XIX.
<br />TWO BOYS INVESTIGATE</h2>
<p>Turning, the two girls, with arms locked, walked
slowly back toward their home cabin, but their gaze
was following the rapidly disappearing boys.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My, how they did scramble over the rocks. I
wonder why they went over the top. I&rsquo;m sure one
can see better from up there,&rdquo; Dories turned to her
friend to exclaim with enthusiasm. &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t Dick
Burton the nicest boy? I&rsquo;m ever so glad he came.
He&rsquo;ll add a lot to our good times.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nann nodded. &ldquo;One can tell in a moment that
Dick has been well brought up,&rdquo; she commented.
&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it too bad that Gib isn&rsquo;t going to have a chance
to make something of himself? I believe he would
be a writer if he had an education. You know how
imaginative he is and how he enjoyed telling us the
story of the Phantom Yacht.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girls sauntered along to the point of rocks
and stood watching the waves break over the boulders
that projected into the water.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_140">[140]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it queer how calm it is sometimes and how
rough at others, and yet there isn&rsquo;t a bit of wind
blowing, and it&rsquo;s as warm and balmy one time as
another,&rdquo; Dories said, then leaped back with a merry
laugh as an unusually large breaker pursued her up
the beach.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think it may be the stage of the tides,&rdquo; Nann
speculated, &ldquo;or else there may have been a storm at
sea. O good! Here come the boys.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dick&rsquo;s expressive face told the girls of his disappointment
before he spoke. &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t see a thing
unusual,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Of course we couldn&rsquo;t go far
because of the marsh.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It sure is too bad the surf&rsquo;s crashin&rsquo; in the way
&rsquo;tis today,&rdquo; Gibralter told them. &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s Dick, come
all the way from Boston to stay till Sunday night,
jest so&rsquo;s we could go up that little creek in the marsh.
He&rsquo;s wild to get into the ol&rsquo; ruin, aren&rsquo;t you, Dick?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yep,&rdquo; the other boy agreed, &ldquo;but if we can&rsquo;t
make it this week end, I&rsquo;ll come down next.&rdquo; Then
with sudden interest, &ldquo;How long are you girls going
to be here on Siquaw Point?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Although Dick asked the question of Nann, it was
Dories who replied. &ldquo;Aunt Jane said this morning
that she thinks we will be leaving in about ten days
now. You see,&rdquo; by way of explanation, &ldquo;my elderly
aunt came down here for absolute rest, and now that
she is rested, we may go back to town sooner than
we expected.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_141">[141]</div>
<p>The four young people had seated themselves on
the rocks.</p>
<p>Nann put in with: &ldquo;I, for one, don&rsquo;t want to leave
this place until we have cleared up a few of the
mysteries.&rdquo; Then, chancing to thrust her hand in
the pocket of her sweater-coat, she drew out a half
dozen slips of crumpled yellow paper. &ldquo;Oh, Gib,&rdquo;
she exclaimed, &ldquo;where in the world do you suppose
these came from? We find them in the queerest
places. We can&rsquo;t understand in the least who is
leaving them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gibralter&rsquo;s face was a blank. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s that writin&rsquo;
on &rsquo;em?&rdquo; He picked one up as he spoke and scrutinized
it closely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In nine days you shall know all,&rdquo; Dick read as
he looked over his friend&rsquo;s shoulder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Know all o&rsquo; what?&rdquo; Gib queried.</p>
<p>The boys looked from Dories to Nann. The girls
shook their heads. &ldquo;We thought maybe you could
help clear up some of the mysteries,&rdquo; the latter said.
&ldquo;Have you ever heard of any queer person hanging
around this beach? A hermit or a&mdash;a&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gib leaned forward, his red-brown eyes gleaming.
&ldquo;D&rsquo;y mean, mabbe, the lantern person that yo&rsquo; uns
saw one night on the rocks?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_142">[142]</div>
<p>Nann nodded. &ldquo;We thought it might be someone
who visited the ruin by night and&mdash;&rdquo; the speaker
glanced at the visiting boy, then interrupted herself
to inquire, &ldquo;Dick, do you remember whether your
people left your cabin locked or not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The lad addressed turned and looked at the cottage
nearest for a moment as though trying to recall
something. Then a lightening in his eyes proved
that he had succeeded. Springing to his feet, he
exclaimed, &ldquo;I declare if I hadn&rsquo;t forgotten it. I&rsquo;m
glad you spoke, Miss Nann. Mother said that in
the hurry of getting away she wasn&rsquo;t sure whether
or not she had locked the back door. She always
hides the key under the back porch, so that if any
one of us comes down out of season, he can get in.&rdquo;
Then, when the others had also risen, Dick suggested,
&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s walk around that way and see what
we will see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dories glanced quickly at Nann and saw that her
friend was gazing steadily at an upper window. She
surmised that Nann was trying to decide whether
or not to tell the boys that she had seen the blind
moving, for, after all, how could she be sure but
that it had been her imagination. The watcher saw
Nann&rsquo;s expression change to one of suppressed excitement,
then she whirled with her back to the
cottage and said in a low voice, &ldquo;Everybody turn
and look at the ocean. I want to tell you something.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_143">[143]</div>
<p>Puzzled indeed, the boys and Dories faced about
as Nann had done, and, to help her friend, the other
maid pointed out toward the island. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s this all
about?&rdquo; Dick inquired. &ldquo;Miss Nann, you look as
though you had seen something startling. What
is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Very quietly Nann explained how for the third
time she had seen an upper blind open ever so little
as though someone was peering out at them, and
then close again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You think someone is hiding in our cottage?&rdquo;
Dick asked in amazement. Nann nodded. &ldquo;Well
then, we&rsquo;ll soon find out.&rdquo; The city boy&rsquo;s tone did
not suggest hesitancy or fear. &ldquo;You girls would
better go over to your own cabin and wait until we
join you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was quite evident that Nann did not like this
suggestion, but Dories did, and said so frankly.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll run home anyway,&rdquo; she said when she saw how
disappointed Nann was. &ldquo;Probably Aunt Jane would
like me to read to her.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_144">[144]</div>
<p>And so it was that Nann accompanied the two
boys around to the back of the Burton cottage. As
before, the door creaked open, and very stealthily
they entered the dark kitchen. This being the largest
cottage in the row, the stairway was boarded off
from a narrow hall; there being a door at the foot
and another at the top. The one at the bottom was
unlocked, and so the three investigators began the
ascent, groping their way in the dark. &ldquo;Wish&rsquo;t we
had along some matches,&rdquo; Gib began, when Nann
whispered, &ldquo;I do believe that I have some. I took
a dozen with us this morning. Yes, here they are in
my watch pocket.&rdquo; Dick, in the lead, took the
matches, and as he opened the upper door, he
scratched one. It very faintly illumined a long hall
with a boarded-up window at the end.</p>
<p>There were four closed doors along the hall. The
one at the right front would lead into the room
where a window blind had moved. Nann almost
held her breath as Dick, after scratching another
match, tried the door. It did not open. &ldquo;Mabbe it&rsquo;s
jest stuck,&rdquo; Gib suggested. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s all push.&rdquo; This
they did and the door burst open so suddenly that
they plunged headlong into the room and the flicker
of the match went out. How musty and dark it
was! Quickly another match was lighted; but there
seemed to be no occupant other than themselves.
The closet door, standing open, revealed merely row
after row of hooks and shelves. There was no furniture
in the room of a concealing nature. Nann
went at once to the blind and found that it was
swinging slightly. &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; she had to acknowledge,
&ldquo;I believe after all I was wrong in my surmise.
Let&rsquo;s get back. Dories will be worried about me.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_145">[145]</div>
<p>Dick, before leaving the room, hooked the blind
carefully on the inside, and, after closing the window,
he remarked, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s queer Mother should have
left a window open as well as the back door. But
I remember now. She said that they were afraid of
losing the train. Something had delayed them. I
had gone on ahead to start school.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When they were again safely out in the sunshine,
Nann inquired, &ldquo;I wonder where your mother left
the key. It isn&rsquo;t in the door.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Before replying Dick went to one corner beneath
the porch, removed a lattice door which could not
have been discovered by anyone not knowing about
it, reached his hand around to one of the uprights
where, on a nail, he found the key hanging. He held
it up triumphantly. Then, after locking the kitchen
door, he replaced the key and the lattice, exclaiming
as he did so, &ldquo;I believe I understand now what happened.
In the hurry, Mother put the key in the right
place without having locked the door, so that&rsquo;s that.&rdquo;
But Nann was not entirely convinced.</p>
<p>The late afternoon fog was drifting in when the
three started to walk along the beach. They saw
Dories running to meet them. &ldquo;Well, thanks be
you&rsquo;re all alive,&rdquo; was her relieved exclamation.</p>
<p>Nann laughed. &ldquo;Did you think a cannibal was
hiding in the Burton cottage?&rdquo; Then she added,
pretending to be disappointed, &ldquo;I had at least hoped
to find a ghost or a&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look! Look!&rdquo; Gib cried excitedly, pointing beyond
the rocks.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_146">[146]</div>
<p>&ldquo;What? Where?&rdquo; the girls scrambled to the top
step of cabin three, which they happened to be passing,
that they might have a better view of whatever
had aroused Gib&rsquo;s interest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it the Phantom Yacht?&rdquo; Nann asked, almost
hoping that it was.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, &rsquo;tisn&rsquo;t that, I&rsquo;m sure, because it isn&rsquo;t white.&rdquo;
Gib continued to stare into the gathering dusk. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
some queer kind of craft, as best I can make out,
and it&rsquo;s scooting away from the shore at a pretty
speedy rate and heading right for the island.&rdquo; For
a moment the young people fairly held their breath
as they watched.</p>
<p>Dick was the first to break in with, &ldquo;Gee-whiliker!
I know what it is! Stupid that I didn&rsquo;t get on to it
from the very first.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, Dick, what do you think it is?&rdquo; Dories
inquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think; I know! It&rsquo;s that seaplane! Look!
There she soars. See her take the air! Now the
pilot&rsquo;s turning her nose, and heading straight for
Boston.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whoever &rsquo;tis in that airplane is takin&rsquo; a purty
big chance,&rdquo; Gibralter commented, &ldquo;startin&rsquo; up with
night a comin&rsquo; on and fog a sailin&rsquo; in.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_147">[147]</div>
<p>Dick was optimistic. &ldquo;He&rsquo;ll keep ahead of the
fog all right, and those high-powered machines
travel so fast he&rsquo;ll be at the landing place, outside of
Boston, before it&rsquo;s really dark. He&rsquo;s safe enough,
but the big question is, who is he, and what was he
doing over there close to the old ruin?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe he knows about that opening in the
swamp,&rdquo; Nann ventured.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I bet ye he does! Like&rsquo;s not he has a little boat
and goes up to the ol&rsquo; ruin in it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But where do you suppose his airship was anchored?&rdquo;
Dories inquired. &ldquo;Probably in the cove
beyond the marsh,&rdquo; Dick replied, when Gib broke in
with, &ldquo;Gee, I sure sartin wish we&rsquo;d taken a chance
and gone out in the punt. I sure do. I&rsquo;d o&rsquo; gone,
but Dick, he was afraid!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The city lad flushed, but he said at once, &ldquo;You
are wrong, Gib, but I promised my mother that I
would only go out in your punt when the tide was
low, and when I give my word, she knows that she
can depend upon it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are right, Dick. It is worth more to have
your mother able to trust you, when you are out of
her sight, than it is to solve all the mysteries that
ever were or will be.&rdquo; Nann&rsquo;s voice expressed her
approval of the city lad. Gib&rsquo;s only comment was,
&ldquo;Wall, how kin we go at low tide? It comes &rsquo;long
&rsquo;bout midnight!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_148">[148]</div>
<p>&ldquo;What if it does? We can&mdash;&rdquo; Dick had started to
say, but interrupted himself to add, &ldquo;&rsquo;Twouldn&rsquo;t be
fair to go without the girls since they found the
opening in the swamp. It will be low tide again
tomorrow noon, and I vote we wait until then.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O, Dick, that&rsquo;s ever so nice of you! We girls
are wild to go.&rdquo; Nann fairly beamed at him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wall, so long. We&rsquo;ll see you &rsquo;bout noon tomorrow.&rdquo;
This from Gib. Dick waved his cap and
smiled back over his shoulder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can hardly wait,&rdquo; Nann said, as the two girls
went into the cabin. &ldquo;I feel in my bones that we&rsquo;re
going to find clues that will solve all of the mysteries
soon.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_149">[149]</div>
<h2 id="c20"><br />CHAPTER XX.
<br />ONE MYSTERY SOLVED</h2>
<p>A glorious autumn morning dawned and Dories
sat up suddenly. Shaking Nann, she whispered
excitedly: &ldquo;I hear it again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What? The ghost? Was he ringing the bell?&rdquo;
This sleepily from the girl who seemed to have no
desire to waken, but, at her companion&rsquo;s urgent:
&ldquo;No, not the bell! Do sit up, Nann, and listen.
Isn&rsquo;t that the airplane coming back? Hark!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Fully awake, the other girl did sit up and listen.
Then leaping from the bed, she ran to the window
that overlooked the wide expanse of marsh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes,&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;There it is! It&rsquo;s flying
low, as though it were going to land, and it&rsquo;s heading
straight for the old ruin. Get dressed as quickly
as you can.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But why?&rdquo; queried the astonished Dories. &ldquo;We
can&rsquo;t get any nearer than we did yesterday; that is,
not by land, and the tide is high again, and so we
can&rsquo;t go out in the punt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nann did not reply, but continued to dress hurriedly,
and so her friend did likewise.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_150">[150]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know why it is,&rdquo; the former confided a
moment later, &ldquo;but I feel in my bones that this is
the day of the great revelation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not according to the yellow messages. They
would tell us that in seven days we would know all.&rdquo;
Dories was brushing her brown hair preparing to
weave it into two long braids.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, as I told you before,&rdquo; Nann remarked, &ldquo;I
don&rsquo;t believe the papers refer to the old ruin mystery
at all. In fact, I think the ghost that writes
the message on the papers does not even know there
is an old ruin mystery.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you&rsquo;re a better detective than I am,&rdquo; Dories
confessed as she tied a ribbon bow on the end of
each braid. &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t any idea about anything that
is happening.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girls stole downstairs and ran out on the
beach, hoping to see the airplane, but the long, shining
white beach was deserted and the only sound
was the crashing of the waves over the rocks and
along the shore, for the tide was high.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder if Dick and Gib heard the plane passing
over their town?&rdquo; Dories had just said, when
Nann, glancing in the direction of the road, exclaimed
gleefully, &ldquo;They sure did, for here they come
at headlong speed this very minute.&rdquo; The big, boney,
white horse stopped so suddenly when it reached the
sand that both of the boys were unseated. Laughingly
they sprang to the beach and waved their caps
to the girls, who hurried to meet them.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_151">[151]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Good morning, boys!&rdquo; Nann called as soon as
they were near enough for her voice to be heard
above the crashing of the waves. &ldquo;I judge you also
saw the plane.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yeah! We&rsquo;uns heerd it comin&rsquo; &rsquo;long &rsquo;fore we
saw it, an&rsquo; we got ol&rsquo; Spindly out&rsquo;n her stall in a
twinklin&rsquo;, I kin tell you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The city lad laughed as though at an amusing
memory. &ldquo;The old mare was sound asleep when
we started, but when she heard that buzzing and
whirring over her head, she thought she was being
pursued by a regiment of demons, seemed like. She
lit out of that barn and galloped as she never had
before. Of course the airplane passed us long ago,
but that gallant steed of ours was going so fast that
I wasn&rsquo;t sure that we would be able to stop her
before we got over to the island.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_152">[152]</div>
<p>Gib, it was plain, was impatient to be away, and
so promising to report if they found anything of
interest, the lads raced toward the point of rocks,
while the girls went indoors to prepare breakfast.
Dories found her Great-Aunt Jane in a happier
frame of mind than usual. She was sitting up in
bed, propped with pillows, when her niece carried in
the tray. And when a few moments later the girl
was leaving the room, she chanced to glance back
and was sure that the old woman was chuckling as
though she had thought of something very amusing.
Dories confided this astonishing news item to Nann
while they ate their breakfast in the kitchen. &ldquo;What
do you suppose Aunt Jane was thinking about? It
was surely something which amused her?&rdquo; Dories
was plainly puzzled.</p>
<p>Nann smiled. &ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t it seem to you that your
aunt must be thoroughly rested by this time? I
should think that she would like to get out in the
sunshine these wonderful bracing mornings. It
would do her a lot more good than being cooped up
indoors.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dories agreed, commenting that old people were
certainly queer. It was midmorning when the girls,
having completed their few household tasks, again
went to the beach to look for the boys. The tide
was going out and the waves were quieter. Arm in
arm they walked along on the hard sand. Dories
was saying, &ldquo;Aunt Jane told me that she would like
to read to herself this morning. I was so afraid that
she would ask me to read to her. Not but that I do
want to be useful sometimes, but this morning I am
so eager to know what the boys are doing. I wish
they would come. I wonder where they went.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_153">[153]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I think I know,&rdquo; Nann replied. &ldquo;I believe they
are lying flat on the big smooth rock on which we
sat that day Gibralter told us the story of the Phantom
Yacht. You recall that we had a fine view of
the old ruin from there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But why would they be lying flat?&rdquo; Dories, who
had little imagination, looked up to inquire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So that they could observe whoever might enter
the old ruin without being observed, my child.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, Nann, why would anyone want to get into
that dreadful place unless it was just out of curiosity,
which, of course, is our only motive.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; the older girl had to
confess, adding: &ldquo;That is a mystery that we have
yet to solve.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Suddenly Nann laughed aloud. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the
joke?&rdquo; This from her astonished companion.
Since Nann continued to laugh, and was pointing
merrily at her, Dories began to bristle. &ldquo;Well,
what&rsquo;s funny about me? Have I buttoned my dress
wrong?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The other maid shook her head. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s something
about your braids,&rdquo; she replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I suppose I put on different colored ribbons.
I remember noticing a yellow one near the red.&rdquo;
She swung both of the braids around as she spoke,
but the ribbon bows were of the same hue. Tossing
them back over her shoulder, she said complacently:
&ldquo;This isn&rsquo;t the first of April, my dear. There&rsquo;s
nothing the matter with my braids and so&mdash;&rdquo; But
Nann interrupted, &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t there? Unbeliever, behold!&rdquo;
Leaping forward, she lifted a braid, held it
in front of her friend, and pointed at a bit of
crumpled yellow paper. Dories laughed, too.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_154">[154]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; Nann exclaimed, &ldquo;that proves to my
entire satisfaction that a supernatural being does <i>not</i>
write the notes and hide them just where we will be
sure to find them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But who do you suppose does write them?&rdquo;
Dories asked. &ldquo;This morning I&rsquo;ve been close enough
to four people to have them slip that folded paper in
my hair ribbon. Their names are Nann Sibbett,
Great-Aunt Jane, Gibralter Strait and Dick Moore.
Dick, of course, is eliminated because he was nowhere
about when the messages first began to appear.
It isn&rsquo;t <i>your</i> hand-writing,&rdquo; the speaker was
closely scrutinizing the note, &ldquo;and, as for Gib, I&rsquo;m
not sure that he can write at all.&rdquo; Then a light of
conviction appeared in her eyes. &ldquo;Do you know
what I believe?&rdquo; she turned toward her friend as
one who had made an astonishing discovery. &ldquo;I
believe Great-Aunt Jane writes these notes and that
she gets up out of bed when we are away from home
and hides them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nann laughed. &ldquo;I agree with you perfectly. I
suspected her the other day, but I didn&rsquo;t want to tell
you until I was more sure. But why do you suppose
she does it&mdash;if she does?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_155">[155]</div>
<p>Dories shook her head, then she exclaimed: &ldquo;Now
I know why Aunt Jane was chuckling to herself
when I looked back. She had just slipped the folded
paper into my hair ribbon, I do believe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The next thing for us to find out is when and
why she does it?&rdquo; The girls had stopped at the foot
of the rocks and Nann changed the subject to say:
&ldquo;I wonder why the boys don&rsquo;t come. It&rsquo;s almost
noon. We&rsquo;ll have to go back and prepare your Aunt
Jane&rsquo;s lunch.&rdquo; She turned toward the home cottage
as she spoke. Dories gave a last lingering look up
toward the tip-top rock. &ldquo;Maybe they have been
carried off in the airplane,&rdquo; she suggested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Impossible!&rdquo; Nann said. &ldquo;It couldn&rsquo;t depart
without our hearing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When they reached the cabin, Dories whispered,
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve nine minds to show Aunt Jane the notes and
watch her expression. I am sure I could tell if she
is guilty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t!&rdquo; Nann warned. &ldquo;Let her have her innocent
fun if she wishes.&rdquo; Then, when they were in
the kitchen making a fire in the wood stove, Nann
added, &ldquo;I believe, my dear girl, that there is more
to the meaning of those messages than just innocent
fun. I believe your Aunt Jane is going to disclose
to you something far more important than the solving
of the ruin mystery. She may tell you where
the fortune is that your father should have had, or
something like that.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_156">[156]</div>
<p>Dories, who had been filling the tea-kettle at the
kitchen pump, whirled about, her face shining.
&ldquo;Nann Sibbett,&rdquo; she exclaimed in a low voice, &ldquo;do
you really, truly think that may be what we are to
know in seven days? O, wouldn&rsquo;t I be glad I came
to this terrible place if it were? Then Mother darling
wouldn&rsquo;t have to sew any more and you and I
could go away to school. Why just all of our
dreams would come true.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Clip fancy&rsquo;s wings, dearie,&rdquo; Nann cautioned as
she cut the bread preparing to make toast. &ldquo;Usually
I am the one imagining things, but now it is you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dories looked at her aunt with new interest when
she went into her room fifteen minutes later with the
tray, but the old woman, who was again lying down,
motioned her to put the tray on a small table near
and not disturb her. As Dories was leaving the
room, her aunt called, &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t need you girls this
afternoon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just as though she divined our wish to go somewhere,&rdquo;
Nann commented, a few moments later,
when Dories had told her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you what let&rsquo;s do,&rdquo; the younger girl suggested,
&ldquo;let&rsquo;s pack a lunch of sandwiches and olives
and cookies. Then when the boys come we can
have a picnic. It&rsquo;s noon and they didn&rsquo;t have a
lunch with them, I am sure.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_157">[157]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Good, that will be fun,&rdquo; Nann agreed. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll look
now and see if they are coming. We don&rsquo;t want
them to escape us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A moment later she returned from the front porch
shaking her head. &ldquo;Not a trace of them,&rdquo; she reported.
Hurriedly they prepared a lunch and packed
it in a box. Then, after donning their bright-colored
tams and sweater coats, they went out the
back door and were just rounding the front of
the cabin when Nann exclaimed, &ldquo;Here they come,
or rather there they go, for they do not seem to
have the least idea of stopping here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nann was right. The two lads had appeared,
scrambling over the point of rocks, and away they
ran along the hard sand of the beach, acknowledging
the existence of the girls merely by a hilarious
waving of the arms.</p>
<p>Nann turned toward her friend, her large eyes
glowing. &ldquo;They&rsquo;ve found a clue, I&rsquo;m sure certain!
You can tell by the way they are racing that they
are just ever so excited about something.&rdquo; As she
spoke the boys disappeared over a hummock of sand,
going in the direction of the inlet where Gibralter
kept his punt hidden.</p>
<p>Dories clapped her hands. &ldquo;I know!&rdquo; she cried
elatedly. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re going out in the punt. The tide
has turned! Oh, Nann, what do you suppose they
saw?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_158">[158]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I believe they saw the pilot of the airplane enter
the old ruin, so now they are going to get the punt,
and they&rsquo;re in a great hurry to get back to the creek
before the airplane leaves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! How exciting! Do you suppose they will
make it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nann intently watched the blue water beyond the
hummock of sand as she replied, &ldquo;I believe they
will.&rdquo; Then she added, &ldquo;Oh, dear, I do hope they&rsquo;ll
take time to stop and get us. It wouldn&rsquo;t be fair for
them to have all the thrills, since we girls found the
channel in the marsh.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course they&rsquo;ll take us,&rdquo; Dories replied, although
in her heart of hearts she rather hoped they
would not, as she was not as eager as Nann for
adventure. &ldquo;You know Dick said it wouldn&rsquo;t be fair
to go without us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nann nodded. Then, with sudden brightening,
&ldquo;Hurry! Here they come! Let&rsquo;s race down to the
point o&rsquo; rocks and see if they want to hail us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then, as they started, &ldquo;Do you know, Dori, I feel
as though something most unexpected is about to
happen. I mean something very different from
what we think.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girls had reached the point of rocks and were
standing with shaded eyes, gazing out at the glistening
water.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_159">[159]</div>
<p>The flat-bottomed boat slowly neared them.
Dick held one oar and Gib the other. They both had
their backs toward the point and evidently they had
not seen the girls.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, I do declare! They aren&rsquo;t going to stop.
They&rsquo;re going right by without us.&rdquo; Nann felt very
much neglected, when suddenly Gib turned and
grinned toward them with so much mischief in his
expression that Dories concluded: &ldquo;They did that
just to tease. See, they&rsquo;re heading in this way now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was true, and Dick, making a trumpet of his
hands, called: &ldquo;Want to come, girls? If so, scramble
over to the flat rock, quick&rsquo;s you can! We&rsquo;re in a
terrifical hurry!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dories and Nann needed no second invitation, but
climbed over the jagged rocks and stood on the
broad one which was uncovered at low tide and
which served as a landing dock.</p>
<p>Dick, the gallant, leaped out to assist them into
the punt, then, seizing his oar, he commanded his
mate, &ldquo;Make it snappy, old man. We want to catch
the modern air pirate before he gets away with his
treasure.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_160">[160]</div>
<h2 id="c21"><br />CHAPTER XXI.
<br />A CHANNEL IN THE SWAMP</h2>
<p>The wind was from the shore and Gib suggested
that the small sail be run up. This was soon done
and away the little craft went bounding over the
evenly rolling waves and, before very many minutes,
the point was rounded and the swamp reached.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where is the airplane anchored?&rdquo; Nann inquired,
peering curiously into the cove which was unoccupied
by craft of any kind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, we aren&rsquo;t sure as to that,&rdquo; Dick told her,
speaking softly as though fearing to be overheard.
&ldquo;We climbed to the top of the rocks and lay there
for hours, or so it seemed to me. We were waiting
for the tide to turn so we could go out in the punt.
But all the time we were there we didn&rsquo;t see or hear
anything of the airplane or the pilot. Of course,
since it&rsquo;s a seaplane, too, it&rsquo;s probably anchored over
beyond the marsh.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_161">[161]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Now my theory is that the pilot has a little tender
and that in it he rowed up the creek and probably,
right this very minute, he is in the old ruin, and like
as not if we go up there we will meet him face to
face.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Br-r-r!&rdquo; Dories shuddered and her eyes were
big and round. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think we&rsquo;d better wait
here? We could hide the punt in the reeds and
watch who comes out. You wouldn&rsquo;t want to meet&mdash;a&mdash;a&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dories was at a loss to conjecture who they might
meet, but Gib chimed in with, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t care who &rsquo;tis!&rdquo;
Then, looking anxiously at the girl who had spoken,
he said, &ldquo;&rsquo;Pears we&rsquo;d ought to&rsquo;ve left you at home.
&rsquo;Pears like we&rsquo;d ought.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boy looked so truly troubled that Dories
assumed a courage she did not feel. &ldquo;No, indeed,
Gib! If you three aren&rsquo;t afraid to meet whoever it
is, neither am I. Row ahead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thus advised, the lad lowered the small sail, and
the two boys rowed the punt to the opening in the
marsh.</p>
<p>It was just wide enough for the punt to enter.
&ldquo;Wall, we uns can&rsquo;t use the oars no further, that&rsquo;s
sure sartin.&rdquo; Gib took off his cap to scratch his ear
as he always did when perplexed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have it!&rdquo; Dick seized an oar, stepped to the
stern, asked Nann to take the seat in the middle of
the boat and then he stood and pushed the punt
into the narrow creek.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_162">[162]</div>
<p>They had not progressed more than two boat-lengths
when a whizzing, whirring noise was heard
and the seaplane scudded from behind a reedy point
which had obscured it, and crossed their cove before
taking to the air. Then it turned its nose toward
the island. All that the watchers could see of the
pilot was his leather-hooded, dark-goggled head, and,
as he had not turned in their direction, it was quite
evident that he didn&rsquo;t know of their existence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gone!&rdquo; Dick cried dramatically. &ldquo;&rsquo;Foiled again,&rsquo;
as they say on the stage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wall, anyhow, we&rsquo;re here, so let&rsquo;s go on up the
creek and see what&rsquo;s in the ol&rsquo; ruin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dick obeyed by again pushing the boat along with
the one oar. Dories said not a word as the punt
moved slowly among the reeds that stood four feet
above the water and were tangled and dense.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s one lucky thing for us,&rdquo; Nann began,
after having watched the dark water at the side of
the craft. &ldquo;That sea serpent you were telling about,
Gib, couldn&rsquo;t hide in this marsh.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe not,&rdquo; Dick agreed, &ldquo;but it&rsquo;s a favorite
feeding ground for slimy water snakes.&rdquo; Nann
glanced anxiously at her friend, then, noting how
pale she was, she changed the subject. &ldquo;How still
it is in here,&rdquo; she commented.</p>
<p>A breeze rustled through the drying reed-tops, but
there was indeed no other sound.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_163">[163]</div>
<p>In and out, the narrow creek wound, making so
many turns that often they could not see three feet
ahead of them.</p>
<p>For a moment the four young people in the punt
were silent, listening to the faint rustle of the dry
reeds all about them in the swamp. There was no
other sound save that made by the flat-bottomed
boat, as Dick, standing in the stern, pushed it with
one oar.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s another curve ahead,&rdquo; Nann whispered.
Somehow in that silent place they could not bring
themselves to speak aloud.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Seems to me the water is getting very shallow,&rdquo;
Dories observed. She was staring over one side of
the boat watching for the slimy snakes Dick had told
her made the marsh their feeding ground.</p>
<p>&ldquo;H-m-m! I wonder!&rdquo; Nann, with half closed
eyes looked meditatively ahead.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wonder what?&rdquo; her friend glanced up to inquire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was thinking that perhaps we won&rsquo;t be able to
go much farther up this channel, since the tide is
going out. The water in the marsh keeps getting
lower and lower.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gee-whiliker, Nann!&rdquo; Dick looked alarmed.
&ldquo;I believe you&rsquo;re right. I&rsquo;ve been thinking for some
seconds that the pushing was harder than it has
been.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_164">[164]</div>
<p>They had reached a turn in the narrow channel as
he spoke, but, when he tried to steer the punt into it,
the flat-bottomed boat stopped with such suddenness
that, had he not been leaning hard on the oar, he
would surely have been thrown into the muddy
water. As it was, he lost his balance and fell on the
broad stern seat. Dories, too, had been thrown forward,
while Gib leaped to the bow to look ahead and
see what had obstructed their progress.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Great fish-hooks! If we haven&rsquo;t run aground,&rdquo;
was the result of his observation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nann&rsquo;s right. This here channel dries up with
the tide goin&rsquo; out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then the only way to get to the old ruin is to
come when the turning tide fills this channel in the
marsh,&rdquo; Dick put in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wall, it&rsquo;s powerful disappointin&rsquo;,&rdquo; Gib looked
his distress, &ldquo;bein&rsquo; as the tide won&rsquo;t turn till &rsquo;long
about midnight, an&rsquo; you&rsquo;ve got to go back to Boston
on the evening train.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d ought to go, to be there in time for school
on Monday,&rdquo; the lad agreed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Couldn&rsquo;t you make it if you took the early morning
train?&rdquo; Nann inquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;May be so,&rdquo; Dick replied, &ldquo;but we can decide
that later. The big thing just now is, how&rsquo;re we
going to get out of this creek?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why&mdash;&rdquo; The girls looked helplessly from one
boy to the other. &ldquo;Is there any problem about it?
Can&rsquo;t you just push out the way you pushed in?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_165">[165]</div>
<p>Dick&rsquo;s expression betrayed his perplexity. &ldquo;Hmm!
I&rsquo;m not at all sure, with the tide going out as fast as
it is now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gracious!&rdquo; Dories looked up in alarm. &ldquo;We
won&rsquo;t have to stay in this dreadful marsh until the
tide turns, will we?&rdquo; Then appealingly, &ldquo;Oh, Dick,
please do hurry and try to get us out of here. Aunt
Jane will be terribly worried if we don&rsquo;t get home
before dark.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boy addressed had already leaped to the stern
of the boat and was pushing on the one oar with all
his strength. Gib snatched the other oar and tried
to help, but still they did not move. Then Nann
had an inspiration. &ldquo;Dori,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;you catch
hold of the reeds on that side and I will on this and
let&rsquo;s pull, too. Now, one, two, three! All together!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Their combined efforts proved successful. The
punt floated, but it was quite evident that they would
have to travel fast to keep from again being
grounded, so they all four continued to push and
pull, and it was with a sigh of relief that they at last
reached deeper water as the channel widened into
the sea.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, that certainly was a narrow escape,&rdquo; Nann
exclaimed as the punt slipped out of the narrow
channel of the marsh into the quiet waters of the
cove.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_166">[166]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Now we know why the pilot of the airplane left.
He probably visits the old ruin only at high tide,
when he is sure that there is water enough in the
creek,&rdquo; Dick announced.</p>
<p>Dories seemed greatly relieved that the expedition
had returned to the open, and, as it was sheltered
in the cove, the boys soon rowed across to the point
of rocks. &ldquo;If Gib could leave the punt here where
the water is so sheltered and quiet, your mother,
Dick, would not object even if you went out when
the tide is high, would she?&rdquo; Nann inquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, indeed,&rdquo; the boy replied. &ldquo;Mother merely
had reference to the open sea. A punt would have
little chance out there if it were caught between the
surf and the rocks, but here it is always calm.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While they had been talking, Gib had been busy
letting his home-made anchor overboard. It was a
heavy piece of iron tied to a rope, which in turn was
fastened to the bow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hold on there, Cap&rsquo;n!&rdquo; Dick merrily called. &ldquo;Let
the passengers ashore before you anchor.&rdquo; Gib
grinned as he drew the heavy piece of iron back into
the punt. Then Dick rowed close to the rocks and
assisted the girls out.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_167">[167]</div>
<p>&ldquo;What shall we do now?&rdquo; he turned to ask when
he saw that Gib had pushed off again. He dropped
the anchor a little more than a boat length from the
point, pulled off his shoes and stockings and waded
to the rocks. After putting them on again he joined
the others, who had started to climb.</p>
<p>When they reached the wide, flat &ldquo;tiptop&rdquo; rock
Dories sank down, exclaiming, &ldquo;Honestly, I never
was so hungry before in all my life.&rdquo; Then, laughingly,
she added, &ldquo;Nann Sibbett, here we have been
carrying that box of lunch all this time and forgot
to eat it. The boys must be starved.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whoopla!&rdquo; Dick shouted. &ldquo;Starved doesn&rsquo;t half
express my famished condition. Does it yours, Gib?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The red-headed boy beamed. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m powerful hungry
all right,&rdquo; he acknowledged, &ldquo;but I&rsquo;m sort o&rsquo;
used to that.&rdquo; However, he sat down when he was
invited to do so and ate the good sandwiches given
him with as much relish as the others.</p>
<p>Half an hour later they were again on the sand
walking toward the row of cottages. Nann glanced
at the upper window of the Burton cabin, and Dick,
noticing, glanced in the same direction. Then, smiling
at the girl, he said, &ldquo;I guess, after all, there has
been no one in the cottage. The blind is still closed
just as I left it yesterday.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll look again tonight,&rdquo; Nann said, adding,
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll each have to carry a lantern.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are you two planning?&rdquo; Dories asked suspiciously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you guess the meaning that underlies our
present conversation?&rdquo; Nann smilingly inquired.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_168">[168]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Goodness, I&rsquo;m almost afraid that I can,&rdquo; was
her friend&rsquo;s queer confession. &ldquo;I do believe you are
plotting a visit to the old ruin at the turn of the tide,
and that will not be until midnight, Gib said.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s something like that,&rdquo; Dick agreed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you can count me out.&rdquo; Dories shuddered
as she spoke.</p>
<p>Nann laughed. &ldquo;I know just exactly what will
happen (this teasingly) when you hear me tiptoeing
down the back stairs. You&rsquo;ll dart after me; for you
know you&rsquo;re afraid to stay alone in our loft at
night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are wrong there,&rdquo; Dories contended. &ldquo;Now
that I know about the ghost, I won&rsquo;t be afraid to
stay alone, and I would be terribly afraid to go to
the ruin at midnight, even with three companions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Speaking of lanterns,&rdquo; Dick put in, &ldquo;if it&rsquo;s foggy
we won&rsquo;t be able to go at all. That would be running
unnecessary risks, but if it is clear, there ought
to be a full moon shining along about midnight, and
that will make all the light we will need.&rdquo; Then he
hastened to add, &ldquo;But we&rsquo;ll take lanterns, for we
might need them inside the old ruin, and what is
more, I&rsquo;ll take my flashlight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boys had left the white horse tied to the cottage
nearest the road. When they had mounted,
Spindly started off as suddenly as hours before it
had stopped.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_169">[169]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Good-bye,&rdquo; Dick waved his cap to the girls,
&ldquo;we&rsquo;ll whistle when we get to the beach.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just look at Spindly gallop,&rdquo; Dories said. &ldquo;The
poor thing is eager to get to its dinner, I suppose.&rdquo;
Arm in arm they turned toward their home-cabin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My, such exciting things are happening!&rdquo; Nann
exclaimed joyfully. &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t have missed this
month by the sea for anything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dories shuddered. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have to confess that I&rsquo;m
not very keen about visiting the old ruin at&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
She interrupted herself to cry out excitedly, &ldquo;Nann,
do look over toward the island. We forgot all about
that sea plane. There it is just taking to the air.
What do you suppose it has been doing out on that
desolate island all this time?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nann shook her head, then shaded her eyes to
watch the airplane as it soared high, again headed
for Boston.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Little do you guess, Mr. Pilot,&rdquo; she called to
him, &ldquo;that tonight we are to discover the secret of
your visits to the old ruin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe!&rdquo; Dories put in laconically.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_170">[170]</div>
<h2 id="c22"><br />CHAPTER XXII.
<br />THE OLD RUIN AT MIDNIGHT</h2>
<p>Never had two girls been more interested and
excited than were Dories and Nann as midnight
neared. Of course they neither of them slept a wink
nor had they undressed. Nann had truly prophesied.
Dories declared that when she came to think of it,
nothing could induce her to stay alone in that loft
room at midnight, and that if she were to meet a
ghost or any other mysterious person, she would
rather meet him in company of Nann, Dick and Gib.</p>
<p>Every hour after they retired, they crept from
bed to gaze out of the small window which overlooked
the ocean. At first the fog was so dense that
they could see but dimly the white line of rushing
surf out by the point of rocks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, we might as well give up the plan,&rdquo; Dories
announced as it neared eleven and the sky was still
obscured.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_171">[171]</div>
<p>But Nann replied that when the moon was full it
often succeeded in dispelling the fog by some magic
it seemed to possess, and that she didn&rsquo;t intend to go
to sleep until she was sure that the boys weren&rsquo;t
coming. She declared that she wouldn&rsquo;t miss the
adventure for anything.</p>
<p>Dories fell asleep, however, and, for that matter,
so, too, did Nann, and since they were both very
weary from the unusual excitement and late hours,
they would not have awakened until morning had it
not been for a low whistle at the back of the cabin.</p>
<p>Instantly Nann sprang up. &ldquo;That must be Gib,&rdquo;
she whispered. Then added, jubilantly: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s as
bright as day. The moon is shining now in all its
splendor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In five seconds the two girls had crept down the
outer stairway, and as they tiptoed across the back
porch, two dark forms emerged from the shadows
and approached them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hist!&rdquo; Gib whispered melodramatically, bent on
making the adventure as mysterious as possible.
&ldquo;You gals track along arter us fellows, and don&rsquo;t
make any noise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then without further parley, Gib darted into the
shadow of the woodshed, and from there crept
stealthily along back of the seven boarded-up cabins.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the idea of stealing along like this?&rdquo;
Nann inquired when the wide sandy spaces were
reached.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_172">[172]</div>
<p>&ldquo;We thought we&rsquo;d keep hidden as much as possible,&rdquo;
Dick told her. &ldquo;For if that airplane pilot
is anywhere around, we don&rsquo;t want him to get wise
to us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, of course, he isn&rsquo;t around,&rdquo; Dories said.
&ldquo;How could he be? An airplane can&rsquo;t fly over our
beach without being heard. It would waken us from
the deepest sleep, I am sure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They were walking four abreast toward the point
which loomed darkly ahead of them. &ldquo;I suppose
you&rsquo;re right,&rdquo; Dick agreed, &ldquo;but it sort of adds to
the zip of it to pretend we&rsquo;re going to steal upon that
airplane pilot and catch him at whatever it is that he
comes here to do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girls did not need much assistance in climbing
the rocks nor in descending on the side of the
cove. Gibralter, as before, removed his shoes and
stockings, waded out to the punt, drew up the anchor
and then returned for the others. The moon had
risen high enough in the clear starlit sky to shine
down into the narrow channel in the marsh and, as
the water deepened continually and was flowing inward,
it was merely a matter of steering the flat-bottomed
boat, which the boys did easily, Dick in
the stern with an oar while Gib in the bow caught the
reeds first on one side and then on the other, thus
keeping the blunt nose of the punt always in the
middle of the creek.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_173">[173]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Sh! Don&rsquo;t say a loud word,&rdquo; Gib cautioned, as
they reached the curve where the afternoon before
they had run aground.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Goodness, you make me feel shivery all over,&rdquo;
Dories whispered. &ldquo;Who do you suppose would
hear if we did speak out loud?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dunno,&rdquo; Dick replied, &ldquo;but we won&rsquo;t take any
chances.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The creek was perceptibly widening and the rising
tide carried them along more swiftly, but still the
reeds were high over their heads and so, even though
Dick was standing as he pushed with an oar, he
could not see the old ruin, but abruptly the marsh
ended and there, high and dry on a mound, stood
the object of their search, looking more forlorn and
haunted than it had from a distance.</p>
<p>The boys had been about to run the boat up on
the mound, when suddenly, and without a sound of
warning, Dick shoved the punt as fast he could back
into the shelter of the reeds from which they had
just emerged.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why d&rsquo;y do that?&rdquo; Gib inquired in a low voice.
&ldquo;D&rsquo;y see anything that scared you, kid?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I saw it, too!&rdquo; Dories eyes were wide and startled.
&ldquo;That is, I thought I saw a light, but it went
out so quickly I decided maybe it was the moonlight
flashing on something.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_174">[174]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe it was and maybe it wasn&rsquo;t.&rdquo; Dick moved
the punt close to the edge of the reeds that they
might observe the ruin from a safe distance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But who could be in there?&rdquo; Nann wondered.
&ldquo;We have never seen anyone around except the pilot
of the airplane and we have all agreed that he can&rsquo;t
be here tonight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, he isn&rsquo;t!&rdquo; Dick was fast recovering his
courage. &ldquo;I believe Dories may have been right
Probably it was only reflected moonlight. Perhaps
you girls had better remain in the punt while we
fellows investigate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, indeed, we&rsquo;ll all go together.&rdquo; Nann settled
the matter. &ldquo;Now shove back up to the mound,
Dick, and let&rsquo;s get out.&rdquo; This was done and the
four young people climbed from the punt and stood
for a long silent moment staring at the ruin that
loomed so dark and desolate just ahead of them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thar &rsquo;tis! Thar&rsquo;s that light agin!&rdquo; Gib seized
his friend&rsquo;s arm and pointed, adding with conviction:
&ldquo;Dori was right. It&rsquo;s suthin&rsquo; swingin&rsquo; in the
wind an&rsquo; flashin&rsquo; in the moonlight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gib,&rdquo; Nann said, &ldquo;that is probably what the
people in Siquaw Center have seen on moonlight
nights.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Like&rsquo;s not!&rdquo; the red-headed lad agreed. Then
stealthily they tiptoed toward the two tall pillars that
stood like ghostly sentinels in front of the roofless
part of the house which had once been the salon.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_175">[175]</div>
<p>The side walls were crumbled, but the rear wall
stood erect, supporting one side of the roof which
tipped forward till it reached the ground, although
one corner was upheld by a heap of fallen stone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose we&rsquo;ll have to creep beneath that corner
if we want to see what&rsquo;s under the roof,&rdquo; Dick said.
He looked anxiously at the girls as he spoke, but
Nann replied briskly, &ldquo;Of course we will. Who&rsquo;ll
lead the way?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Since I have a flashlight, I will,&rdquo; the city boy
offered. &ldquo;Here, Nann, give me your lantern and
I&rsquo;ll light it. Then if you girls get separated from
us boys, you won&rsquo;t be in the dark.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Goodness, Dick!&rdquo; Dories shivered. &ldquo;What in
the world is going to separate us? Can&rsquo;t we keep
all close together?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Course we can,&rdquo; Gib cheerfully assured her.
&ldquo;Dick kin go in furst, you girls follow, an&rsquo; I&rsquo;ll be
rear guard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean I can go in when I find an opening,&rdquo;
the city boy turned back to whisper. Somehow they
just couldn&rsquo;t bring themselves to talk out loud.</p>
<p>Nann held her lantern high and looked at the
corner nearest where a crumbling wall upheld the
roof. &ldquo;There ought to be room to creep in over
there,&rdquo; she pointed, &ldquo;if it weren&rsquo;t for all that debris
on the ground.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_176">[176]</div>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll soon dispose of that,&rdquo; Dick said, going to
the spot and placing his flashlight on a rock that it
might illumine their labors. The two boys fell to
work with a will tossing away bricks and stones and
broken pieces of plaster.</p>
<p>At last an opening large enough to be entered on
hands and knees appeared. Dick cautioned the girls
ta stay where they were until he had investigated.
Dories gave a little startled cry when the boy disappeared,
fearing that the wall or the roof might fall
on him. After what seemed like a very long time,
they heard a low whistle on the inside of the opening.
Gib peered under and received whispered instructions
from Dick. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s safe enough as far as
I can see. Bring the girls in.&rdquo; And so Dories crept
through the opening, followed by Nann and Gib.
Rising to their feet they found themselves in what
had one time been a large and handsomely furnished
drawing-room. A huge chandelier with dangling
crystals still hung from the cross-beams, and in the
night wind that entered from above they kept up a
constant low jangling noise. Heavy pieces of mahogany
furniture were tilted at strange angles where
the rotting floor had given way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Watch your step, girls,&rdquo; Dick, in the lead, turned
to caution. &ldquo;See, there&rsquo;s a big hole ahead. I&rsquo;ll go
around it first to be sure that the boards will hold.
Aha, yonder is a partition that is still standing. I
wonder what room is beyond that.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_177">[177]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Look out, Dick!&rdquo; came in a low terrorized cry
from Dories. The boy turned to see the girl, eyes
wide and frightened, pointing toward a dark corner
ahead. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a man crouching over there. I&rsquo;m
sure of it! I saw his face.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Instantly Dick swung the flashlight until it illumined
the corner toward which Dories was still pointing.
There was unmistakably a face looking at them
with piercing dark eyes that were heavily overhung
with shaggy grey brows.</p>
<p>For one terrorized moment the four held their
breath. Even Dick and Gib were puzzled. Then,
with an assumption of bravery, the former called:
&ldquo;Say, who are you? Come on out of there. We&rsquo;re
not here to harm anything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the upper part of the face (that was all they
could see) did not change expression, and so Dick
advanced nearer. Then his relieved laughter pealed
forth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some man&mdash;that,&rdquo; he said, as he flashed the
light beyond the pile of debris which partly concealed
the face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, if it isn&rsquo;t an old painting!&rdquo; Nann ejaculated.</p>
<p>And that, indeed, was what it proved to be. Battered
by its fall, the broken frame stood leaning
against a partition.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_178">[178]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I believe its a portrait of that cruel old Colonel
Woodbury himself,&rdquo; Dories remarked. Then eagerly
added, &ldquo;I do wish we could find a picture of that
sweet girl, his daughter. Ever since Gib told us
her story I have thought of her as being as lovely
as a princess. Though I don&rsquo;t suppose a real princess
is always beautiful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should say not! I&rsquo;ve seen pictures of them
that couldn&rsquo;t hold a candle to Nann, here.&rdquo; This was
Dick&rsquo;s blunt, boyish way of saying that he admired
the fearless girl.</p>
<p>Gib, having found a heavy cane, was poking
around in the piles of debris that bordered the partition
and his exclamation of delight took the others
to his side as rapidly as they could go.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What have you found, old man?&rdquo; Dick asked,
eagerly peering at a heap of rubbish.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nuther picture, seems like, or leastwise I reckon
it&rsquo;s one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gib busied himself tossing stones and fragments
of plaster to one side, and when he could free it, he
lifted a canvas which faced the wall and turned it so
that light fell full upon it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gee-whiliker, it&rsquo;s yer princess all right, all
right!&rdquo; he averred. &ldquo;Say, wasn&rsquo;t she some beaut,
though?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_179">[179]</div>
<p>There were sudden tears in Nann&rsquo;s eyes as she
spoke. &ldquo;Oh, you poor, poor girl,&rdquo; she said as she
bent above the pictured face, &ldquo;how you have suffered
since that long-ago day when some artist painted
your portrait.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Even then she wasn&rsquo;t happy,&rdquo; Dories put in
softly. &ldquo;See that little half-wistful smile? It&rsquo;s as
though she felt much more like crying.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now she is a woman and over in Europe
somewhere with a little girl and boy,&rdquo; Nann took up
the tale; but Gib amended: &ldquo;Not so very little.
Didn&rsquo;t we cal&rsquo;late that if they&rsquo;re livin&rsquo; the gal&rsquo;d be
about sixteen, an&rsquo; the boy eighteen or nineteen?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, that&rsquo;s so.&rdquo; Nann looked up brightly.
&ldquo;When I spoke I was remembering the story as you
told it, and how sad the young mother looked when
she landed from the snow-white yacht and led a
little boy and girl up to this very house to beg her
father to forgive her. But I recall now, you said
that was at least ten years ago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What shall we do with this beautiful picture?&rdquo;
Dories inquired. &ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t seem a bit right to
leave it here in all this rubbish, now that we&rsquo;ve
found it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s take it into the next room,&rdquo; Dick said;
&ldquo;maybe we&rsquo;ll find a better place to leave it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They had reached an opening in the rear partition,
but the heavy carved door still hung on one
hinge, obstructing their passage.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_180">[180]</div>
<p>&ldquo;We <i>must</i> get through somehow,&rdquo; Nann, the adventurous,
said. &ldquo;I feel in my bones that the next
room holds something that will help solve the mystery
of the air pilot&rsquo;s visits.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dories held the painting while Nann flashed the
light where it would best aid the boys in removing
the debris that held the old door in such a way that
it obstructed their passage into the room back of
the salon.</p>
<p>A long half-hour passed and the boys labored,
lifting stones and heavy pieces of ceiling, but, when
at last the floor space in front of the heavy door was
cleared, they found that something was holding it
tight shut on the other side.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gee-whiliker!&rdquo; Dick ejaculated, removing his
cap and wiping his brow. &ldquo;Talk about buried treasure.
If it&rsquo;s as hard to get at as it is to get through
this door, I&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was interrupted by the younger girl, who said:
&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s pretend there is a treasure behind this door,
and after all, maybe there is. Perhaps the air pilot
is a smuggler of some kind and brings things here
to hide.&rdquo; Dories had made a suggestion which had
not occurred to the boys.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s so!&rdquo; Dick agreed. &ldquo;But if he gets into
the next room, he must have an entrance around at
the back of the ruin. No one has been through this
door since the flood undermined the old house.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_181">[181]</div>
<p>Gib was still trying to open the stubborn door.
He put his shoulder against it. &ldquo;Come on, Dick,
help a fellow, will you?&rdquo; he sang out.</p>
<p>The boys pushed as hard as they could and the
door moved just the least bit, then seemed to wedge
in a way that no further assaults upon it could
effect.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whizzle! What if that pilot feller is on the
other side holdin&rsquo; it. What if he is?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But he couldn&rsquo;t be,&rdquo; Nann protested. &ldquo;We all
agreed long ago that he couldn&rsquo;t be here because how
could he arrive in the airplane without being heard?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know what I&rsquo;m a-goin&rsquo; to do,&rdquo; Gib&rsquo;s expression
was determined. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a-goin&rsquo; to smash a hole in
that ol&rsquo; door and crawl through.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dick sprang to get a heavy stone from one of the
crumbling side walls and Gib, having procured another,
the two boys began a battering which soon
resulted in a loud splintering sound and one of the
heavy panels was crashed in.</p>
<p>Gib wiggled his way through and Dick handed
him the searchlight. &ldquo;Huh, we&rsquo;re bright uns, we
are!&rdquo; came in a muffled voice from the other room.
&ldquo;Thar&rsquo;s as much rubbish a holdin&rsquo; the door on this
side as thar was on the other, but I, fer one, jest
won&rsquo;t move a stick o&rsquo; it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No need to!&rdquo; Nann said blithely. &ldquo;Make that
hole a little bigger and we can all go through the
way you did.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_182">[182]</div>
<p>This was quickly done and the boys assisted the
two girls through the opening. Then they stood
close together looking about them as Dick flashed
the light. The room was not quite as much of a
wreck as the salon had been. In it a mahogany table
stood and the chairs with heavily carved legs and
backs had been little harmed. With a little cry of
delight, Nann dragged Dories toward an old-fashioned
mahogany sideboard. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you love it?&rdquo;
she said enthusiastically, turning a glowing face
toward her companion. &ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t you adore having
it?&rdquo; But before Dories could voice her admiration,
Dick, having looked at his watch, exclaimed:
&ldquo;Gee-whiliker, I&rsquo;ll have to beat it if I am to catch
that early train back to Boston. I hate to break up the
party.&rdquo; He hesitated, glancing from one to the other.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course you must go!&rdquo; Nann, the sensible, declared.
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s another week-end coming.&rdquo; Then
turning to her friend, who was still holding the picture,
she said: &ldquo;Dori, let&rsquo;s leave the painting of our
princess standing on the old mahogany sideboard.&rdquo;
When this had been done, she addressed the picture:
&ldquo;Good-bye, Lady of the Phantom Yacht. Keep
those sweet blue eyes of yours wide open that you
may tell us what mysterious things go on in this old
ruin while we are away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The pictured eyes were to gaze upon more than
the pictured lips would be able to tell.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_183">[183]</div>
<h2 id="c23"><br />CHAPTER XXIII.
<br />LETTERS OF IMPORTANCE</h2>
<p>The young people found the grey of dawn in the
sky when they emerged through the hole under one
corner of the roof and a new terror presented itself.
&ldquo;What if the receding tide had left their boat high
and dry.&rdquo; But luckily there was still enough water
in the narrow creek to take them out to the cove.
Since they were in haste, the sail was put in place
and a brisk wind from the land took them out and
around the point. There was still too high a surf to
make possible a landing on the platform rock and
so the girls were obliged to go with the boys as far
as the inlet in which Gib kept his punt. The white
horse had been tied to a scrubby tree near, but, before
he mounted, Dick took off his hat and held out
a hand to each of the girls in turn, assuring them
that he had been ever so glad to meet them and that
if all went well, he would return the following
week-end.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_184">[184]</div>
<p>&ldquo;And we will promise not to visit the old ruin
again until you come,&rdquo; Nann told him. The boy&rsquo;s
face brightened. &ldquo;O, I say!&rdquo; he exclaimed, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s
too much to ask.&rdquo; But Gib assured him that half
the fun was having him along.</p>
<p>Just before they rode away, Dick turned to call:
&ldquo;Keep a watch-out on our cabin, will you, Nann?
I really don&rsquo;t believe anyone has been there, however.
Mother remembered that she had left the back
door open.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right. We will. Good-bye.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Slowly the girls walked toward their home-cabin.
&ldquo;Do you suppose we ought to tell Aunt Jane that we
visited the old ruin at midnight?&rdquo; Dories asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, no, dear, I don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; was the thoughtful reply.
&ldquo;Your Aunt Jane told us to do anything we
could find to amuse us, don&rsquo;t you recall, that very
first day after we had opened up the cottage and
were wondering what to do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dories nodded. &ldquo;I remember. She must have
heard us talking while we were dusting and straightening
the living-room. That was the day that I said
I believed the place was haunted, and you said you
hoped there was a ghost or something mysterious.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nann stopped and faced her companion. Her
eyes were merry. &ldquo;Dori Moore,&rdquo; she exclaimed, &ldquo;I
believe your aunt <i>did</i> hear my wish and that she has
been trying to grant it by writing those mysterious
messages and leaving them where we would find
them.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_185">[185]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe you are right,&rdquo; her friend agreed. &ldquo;I
wish we could catch her in the act.&rdquo; Then Dories
added: &ldquo;Nann, if Aunt Jane is really doing that just
for fun, then she can&rsquo;t be such an old grouch as I
thought her. You know I told you how I was sure
that I heard her chuckling.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The older girl nodded, then as the back porch of
the cabin had been reached, they went quietly up the
steps and into the kitchen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s going to be a long week waiting for Dick to
return,&rdquo; Dories said as she began to make a fire in
the stove. &ldquo;What shall we do to pass away the
time?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nann smiled brightly. &ldquo;O, we&rsquo;ll find plenty to
do!&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;There is that box of books in the
loft. Surely there will be a few that we would like
to read and that your Aunt Jane would like to hear.
We have left her alone so much,&rdquo; Nann continued,
&ldquo;don&rsquo;t you think this last week that we ought to
spend more time adding to her happiness if we can?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dories flushed. &ldquo;I wish I&rsquo;d been the one to say
that,&rdquo; she confessed, &ldquo;since Great-Aunt Jane loved
my father so much when he was a boy.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_186">[186]</div>
<p>Although the girls had their breakfast early, it
was not until the usual hour that Dories took the
tray in to her aunt. Nann followed with something
that had been forgotten. They were surprised to see
the old woman propped up in bed reading the book
of ghost stories which Dories had left in the room.
She fairly beamed at them when they entered. Then
she asked, &ldquo;Do you girls believe in ghosts?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no. Aunt Jane,&rdquo; Dories began rather hesitatingly.
&ldquo;That is, I don&rsquo;t believe that I do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The sharp grey eyes, in which a twinkle seemed
to be lurking, turned toward Nann. &ldquo;Do you?&rdquo; she
asked briefly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, indeed, Miss Moore, I do not,&rdquo; was the emphatic
reply, then, just for mischief, the girl asked,
&ldquo;Do you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed I do,&rdquo; was the unexpected response. &ldquo;A
ghost visited me last night and told me that you
girls had gone with Gibralter Strait and the Burton
boy over to visit the old ruin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aunt Jane! Miss Moore!&rdquo; came in two amazed
exclamations.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We did go. I sincerely hope you do not object,&rdquo;
the older girl hastened to say.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t object. There&rsquo;s nothing over there
that can hurt you. Now I&rsquo;d like my breakfast, if
you please.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the girls returned to the kitchen, Dories
whispered, &ldquo;Nann, how in the world did she know?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The older girl shook her head. &ldquo;Mysteries seem
to be piling up instead of being solved,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_187">[187]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Do you suppose Aunt Jane knows who the air
pilot is and why he goes to the old ruin?&rdquo; Dories
wondered as they went about their morning tasks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you what, let&rsquo;s stay around home pretty
closely for a few days and see if anyone does visit
Aunt Jane, shall we?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old woman seemed to be glad to have the
companionship of the girls. They read to her in
the morning, and on the third afternoon their suspicions
were aroused by the fact that their hostess
asked them why they stayed around the cabin all of
the time. It was quite evident to them that she
wanted to be left alone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Would it be too far for you to walk into town
and see if there isn&rsquo;t some mail for me?&rdquo; Miss Moore
inquired early on the fourth morning of the week.
&ldquo;I am expecting some very important letters. That
boy Gibralter was told to bring them the minute they
came, but these Straits are such a shiftless lot.&rdquo;
Then, almost eagerly, looking from one girl to another,
she inquired: &ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t too far for you to
walk, is it? You can hire Gibralter to bring you
back in the stage.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_188">[188]</div>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;d love to go,&rdquo; Nann said most sincerely, and
Dories echoed the sentiment. The truth was the
girls had been puzzled because Gib had not appeared.
Indeed, nothing had happened for four days. Although
they had searched everywhere they could
think of, there had been no message for them telling
in how many days they would know all. An hour
later, when they were walking along the marsh-edged
sandy road leading to town, they discussed
the matter freely, since no one could possibly overhear.
&ldquo;If Aunt Jane really has been writing those
notes and leaving them for us to find, do you suppose
that she has stopped writing them because she
thinks we suspect her of being the ghost?&rdquo; Dories
asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see why she should suspect, as we have
said nothing in her hearing; in fact, we were out on
the beach when I told you that I thought your Aunt
Jane might be writing the notes,&rdquo; Nann replied.</p>
<p>Dories nodded. &ldquo;That is true,&rdquo; she agreed. Then
she stopped and stared at her companion as she exclaimed:
&ldquo;Nann Sibbett, I don&rsquo;t believe that Aunt
Jane writes them at all. I believe Gibralter Strait
does. There hasn&rsquo;t been a note for four days anywhere
in the cabin, and Gib hasn&rsquo;t been to the point
in all that time. There, now, doesn&rsquo;t that seem to
prove my point?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It surely does!&rdquo; Nann said as they started walking
on toward the town. &ldquo;Only I thought we agreed
that probably Gib couldn&rsquo;t write. But I do recall that
he said he went to a country school in the winter
months when his father didn&rsquo;t need him to help in
the store.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_189">[189]</div>
<p>&ldquo;If Gib writes them he is a good actor,&rdquo; Dories
commented. &ldquo;He certainly seemed very much surprised
when we showed him the notes, you remember.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nann agreed. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all very puzzling,&rdquo; she said,
then added, &ldquo;What a queer little hamlet this is?&rdquo;
They were passing the first house in Siquaw Center.
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t suppose there are more than eight houses
in all,&rdquo; she continued. &ldquo;What do you suppose the
people do for a living?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Work on the railroad, I suppose,&rdquo; Nann guessed.
They had reached the ramshackle building that held
the post office and general store when they saw Gib
driving the stage around from the barns. &ldquo;Hi thar!&rdquo;
he called to them excitedly. &ldquo;I got some mail for
yo&rsquo;uns. I was jest a-goin&rsquo; to fetch it over, like I
promised Miss Moore. It didn&rsquo;t come till jest this
mornin&rsquo;. Thar&rsquo;s some mail for yo&rsquo;uns, too. A letter
from Dick Burton. He writ me one along o&rsquo; yourn.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girls climbed up on the high seat by Gib&rsquo;s
side. The day had been growing very warm as noon
neared and they had found it hard walking in the
sand, and so they were not sorry that they were to
ride back. Gib gave them two long legal envelopes
addressed to Miss Moore and the letter from Dick.</p>
<p>Eagerly Nann opened it, as it had been written
especially to her, and after reading it she exclaimed:
&ldquo;Well, isn&rsquo;t this queer?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_190">[190]</div>
<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; Dories, who was consumed with curiosity,
exclaimed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dick writes that he told his mother that he had
found that upper front room window open and the
blind swinging, but she declares that she <i>knows</i> all
of the upper windows were closed and the blinds
securely fastened. She had been in every room to
try them just before she left, and that was what had
delayed her so long that, in her hurry, she took the
key out of the back door, hung it in its hiding place,
without having turned it in the lock. Dick says that
he&rsquo;s wild to get back to Siquaw, and that the first
thing he is going to do is to search in that upper
room for clues.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gib nodded. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s what he wrote into my letter.
He&rsquo;s comin&rsquo; down Friday arter school lets out,
so&rsquo;s we&rsquo;ll have more time over to the ruin. Dick
says he&rsquo;s sot on ferritin&rsquo; out what that pilot fella
does thar.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Old Spindly seemed to feel spryer than usual and
trotted along the sandy road at such a pace that in a
very little while they had reached the end of it at
the beach.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_191">[191]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Wall, so long,&rdquo; Gib called when the girls had
climbed down from the high seat, but before they
had turned to go, he ejaculated: &ldquo;By time, if I didn&rsquo;t
clear fergit ter give yo&rsquo;uns the rest o&rsquo; yer mail.
Here &rsquo;tis!&rdquo; Leaning down, he handed them another
envelope. Before they could look at it, he had
snapped his whip and started back toward town.
The girls watched the old coach sway in the sand
for a minute, then they glanced at the envelope. On
it in red ink was written both of their names.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well of all queer things!&rdquo; Nann ejaculated.
Tearing it open, they found a message: &ldquo;<i>Today you
will know all.</i>&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_192">[192]</div>
<h2 id="c24"><br />CHAPTER XXIV.
<br />A SURPRISING REVELATION</h2>
<p>The girls stood where Gib had left them staring
at each other in puzzled amazement. &ldquo;Well, what
do you make of it?&rdquo; Dories was the first to exclaim.
Nann laughingly shook her head. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know
unless this confirms our theory that Gib writes the
notes. I almost think it does.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They started walking toward the cabin. &ldquo;Well,
time will tell and a short time, too, if we are to know
all today,&rdquo; Dories remarked, then added, &ldquo;That long
walk has made me ravenously hungry and we
haven&rsquo;t a thing cooked up.&rdquo; Then she paused and
sniffed. &ldquo;What is that delicious odor? It smells
like ham and something baking, doesn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We surely are both imaginative,&rdquo; Nann agreed,
&ldquo;for I also scent a most appetizing aroma on the air.
But who could be cooking? We left Miss Moore in
bed and anyway, of course, it is not she.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They had reached the kitchen door and saw that
it was standing open and that the tempting odor was
actually wafting therefrom. Puzzled indeed, they
bounded up the steps.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_193">[193]</div>
<p>A surprising sight met their gaze. Miss Jane
Moore, dressed in a soft lavender gown partly covered
with a fresh white apron, turned from the stove
to beam upon them; her eyes were twinkling, her
cheeks were rosy from the excitement and the heat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aunt Jane! Miss Moore!&rdquo; the girls cried in
astonishment. &ldquo;Ought you to be cooking? Are
you strong enough?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course I am strong enough,&rdquo; was the brisk
reply. &ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t I been resting for nearly two
weeks? I thought probably you girls would be
hungry after your long walk.&rdquo; Then, as she saw
the legal envelopes, she added with apparent satisfaction:
&ldquo;Well, they have come at last, have they?
Put them in on my dresser, Dories; then come right
back. It is such a fine day I thought we would take
the table out on the sheltered side porch and have a
sort of picnic-party.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was hard for the girls to believe that this was
the same old woman who had been so grouchy most
of the time since they had known her. Would surprises
never cease? The girls were delighted with
the plan and carried the small kitchen table to the
sunny, sheltered side porch and soon had it set for
three.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_194">[194]</div>
<p>When they returned they found the flushed old
woman taking a pan of biscuits from the oven.
How good they looked! Then came baked ham and
sweet potatoes, and a brown Betty pudding. The
elderly cook seemed to greatly enjoy the girls&rsquo; surprise
and delight. They made her comfortable in
an easy willowed chair at one end of the table facing
the sea and, when the viands had been served, they
ate with great relish. To their amazement their
hostess partook of the entire menu with as evident
a zest as their own. Dories could no longer remain
silent. &ldquo;Aunt Jane,&rdquo; she blurted out, &ldquo;ought you
to eat so heartily after such a long fast? You
haven&rsquo;t had anything but tea and toast since we
came.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nann had glanced quickly and inquiringly at the
old woman, and the suspicions she had previously
entertained were confirmed by the merry reply: &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
have to confess that I&rsquo;ve been an old fraud.&rdquo; Miss
Moore was chuckling again. &ldquo;Every time you girls
went away and I was sure you were going to be
gone for some time, I got up and had a good meal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, Aunt Jane,&rdquo; Dories&rsquo; brow gathered in a
puzzled frown, &ldquo;why did you have to do that? It
would have been a lot more fun all along to have
had our dinners all together like this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss Moore nodded. &ldquo;Yes, it would have been,
but I&rsquo;m an odd one. There was something I wanted
to find out and I took my own queer way of going
about it.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_195">[195]</div>
<p>&ldquo;D&mdash;did you find it out, Aunt Jane?&rdquo; Dories
asked, almost anxiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes and no,&rdquo; was the enigmatical answer. Then,
tantalizingly, she remarked as she leaned back in
her comfortable willow chair, having finished her
share of the pudding, &ldquo;This is wonderful weather,
isn&rsquo;t it, girls? If it keeps up I won&rsquo;t want to go
back next Monday. Perhaps we&rsquo;ll stay a week longer
as I had planned when we first came.&rdquo; Then before
the girls could reply, the grey eyes that could be so
sharply penetrating turned to scrutinize Dories.
&ldquo;You look much better than you did when we came.
You had a sort of fretful look as though you had
a grudge against life. Now you actually look eager
and interested.&rdquo; Then, after a glance at Nann, &ldquo;You
are both getting brown as Indians.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Would Miss Moore never come to the subject that
was uppermost in the thoughts of the two girls? If
she had written the message telling them that today
they were to know all, why didn&rsquo;t she begin the
story, if it was to be a story?</p>
<p>How Dories hoped that she was to hear what had
become of the fortune she had always believed
should have been her father&rsquo;s. Her own mother
had never told her anything about it, but she had
heard them talking before her father died; she had
not understood them, but as she grew older she
seemed vaguely to remember that there should have
been money from somewhere, enough to have kept
poverty from their door and more, probably, since
her father&rsquo;s Aunt Jane had so much.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_196">[196]</div>
<p>But Miss Moore rose without having satisfied
their burning curiosity. &ldquo;Now, girls,&rdquo; she said,
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go in and read my letters while you wash the
dishes. Later, when the fog drifts in, build a fire
on the hearth and I&rsquo;ll tell you a story.&rdquo; Then she
left them, going to her own room and closing the
door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m so excited that I can hardly carry the dishes
without dropping them,&rdquo; Dories confided to Nann
when at last they had returned the table to its place
in the kitchen and were busily washing and drying
the dishes. &ldquo;What do you suppose the story is to
be about?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You and your mother and father chiefly, I believe,&rdquo;
Nann said with conviction.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aunt Jane&rsquo;s saying that she had a story to tell
us proves, doesn&rsquo;t it, that she wrote the messages?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think so, Dori.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope the fog will come in early,&rdquo; the younger
girl remarked as she hung up the dish-wiper on the
line back of the stove.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It will. It always does. Now let&rsquo;s go out to the
shed and bring in a big armful of driftwood. There&rsquo;s
one log that I&rsquo;ve been saving for some special occasion.
Surely this is it.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_197">[197]</div>
<p>As Nann had said, the fog came in soon after
midafternoon; the girls had drawn the comfortable
willow chair close to the hearth. The wood was in
place and eagerly the girls awaited the coming of
their hostess. At last the bedroom door opened and
Miss Moore, without the apron over her lavender
dress, emerged. Although she smiled at them, the
discerning Nann decided that the letters had contained
some disappointing news. Dories at once set
fire to the driftwood and a cheerful blaze leaped up.
When Miss Moore was seated the girls sat on lower
chairs close together. Their faces told their eager
curiosity.</p>
<p>Glancing from one to the other, their hostess said:
&ldquo;Dori, you and Nann have been the best of friends
for years, I think you wrote me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, Aunt Jane,&rdquo; was the eager reply, &ldquo;we
started in kindergarten together and we&rsquo;ve been in
the same classes through first year High, but now
Nann&rsquo;s father has taken her away from me. They
are going to live in Boston. And so a favorite dream
of ours will never be fulfilled, and that was to graduate
together.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If only your mother would consent to come and
live with me, then your wish would be fulfilled,&rdquo; the
old woman began when Dories exclaimed, &ldquo;Why,
Aunt Jane, I didn&rsquo;t even know that you <i>wanted</i> us
to live with you in Boston.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_198">[198]</div>
<p>Miss Moore nodded gravely. &ldquo;But I do and have.
I have written your mother repeatedly, since my
dear nephew died, telling her that I would like you
three to make your home with me, but it seems that
she cannot forget.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Forget what?&rdquo; Dories leaned forward to inquire.
Nann had been right, she was thinking. The something
they were to know did relate to her father&rsquo;s
affairs, she was now sure.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_199">[199]</div>
<p>The old woman seemed not to have heard, for
she continued looking thoughtfully at the fire. &ldquo;I
know that she has forgiven,&rdquo; she said at last. &ldquo;Your
mother is too noble a woman not to do that, but her
pride will not let her forget.&rdquo; Then, turning toward
the girls who sat each with a hand tightly clasped
in the others, the speaker continued: &ldquo;I must begin
at the beginning to make the sad story clear. I loved
your father, as I would have loved a son. I brought
him up when his parents were gone. The money
belonged to my father and he used to say that he
would leave your father&rsquo;s share in my keeping, as
he believed in my judgment. I was to turn it over
to my nephew when I thought best.&rdquo; She was silent
a moment, then said: &ldquo;When your father was old
enough to marry, I wanted him to choose a girl I had
selected, but instead, when he went away to study
art, he married a school teacher of whom I had never
heard. I believed that she was designing and marrying
him for his money, and I wrote him that unless
he freed himself from the union I would never give
him one cent. Of course he would not do that, and
rightly. Later, in my anger, I turned over to him
some oil stock which had proved valueless and told
him that was all he was to have. Then began long,
lonely years for me because I never again heard from
the nephew whose boyish love had been the greatest
joy life had ever brought me. I was too stubborn
to give him the money which legally I had the right
to withhold from him, and he was so hurt that he
would not ask my forgiveness. But, when I heard
that my boy had died, my heart broke, and I knew
myself for what I was&mdash;a selfish, stubborn old
woman who had not deserved love and consideration.
Then, but far too late, I tried to redeem myself
in the eyes of your mother. I wrote, begging her
to come and bring her two children to my home. I
told her how desolate I had been since my boy, your
father, had left. Very courteously your mother
wrote that, as long as she could sew for a living for
herself and her two children, she would not accept
charity. Then I conceived the plan of becoming
acquainted with you, for two reasons: one that I
might discover if in any way you resembled your
father, and the other was that I wanted you to use
your influence to induce your mother to forget, as
well as forgive, and to live with me in Boston and
make my cheerless mansion of a house into a real
home.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_200">[200]</div>
<p>She paused and Dories, seeing that there were
tears in the grey eyes, impulsively reached out a hand
and took the wrinkled one nearest her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear Aunt Jane, how you have suffered.&rdquo; Nann
noted with real pleasure that her friend&rsquo;s first reaction
had been pity for the old woman and not
rebellion because of the act that had caused her to
be brought up in poverty. &ldquo;Mother has always said
that you meant to be kind, she was convinced of that,
but she never told me the story. This is the first
time that I understood what had happened. Truly,
Aunt Jane, if you really wish it, I shall urge Mother
to let us all three come and live with you. Selfishly
I would love to, because I would be near Nann, if
for no other reason, but I have another reason. I
believe my father would wish it. Mother has often
told me that, as a boy, he loved you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old woman held the girl&rsquo;s hand in a close
clasp and tears unheeded fell over her wrinkled
cheeks. &ldquo;But it&rsquo;s too late now,&rdquo; she said dismally.</p>
<p>Dories and Nann exchanged surprised glances.
&ldquo;Too late, Aunt Jane?&rdquo; Dories inquired. &ldquo;Do you
mean that you do not care to have us now?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_201">[201]</div>
<p>&ldquo;No, indeed, not that!&rdquo; The old woman wiped
away the tears, then smiled tremulously. &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t
finished the story as yet. This is the last chapter,
I fear. I ought to be glad for your mother&rsquo;s sake,
but O, I have been so lonely.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then, seeing the intense eagerness in her niece&rsquo;s
face, she concluded with, &ldquo;I must not keep you in
such suspense, my dear. That long legal envelope
brought me news from your father&rsquo;s lawyer. It is
news that your mother has already received, I presume.
The stock, which I turned over to your father
years ago, believing it to be worthless, has turned
out to be of great value. Your mother will have a
larger income than my own, and now, of course, she
will not care to make her home with me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O, Aunt Jane!&rdquo; To the surprise of both of the
others, the girl threw her arms about the old
woman&rsquo;s neck and clung to her, sobbing as though
in great sorrow, but Nann knew that the tears were
caused by the sudden shock of the joyful revelation.
The old woman actually kissed the girl, and then
said: &ldquo;I expected to be very sad because I cannot
do something for you all to prove the deep regret I
feel for my unkind action, but, instead, I am glad,
for I know that only in this way would your mother
acquire the real independence which means happiness
for her.&rdquo; With a sigh, she continued: &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve lived
alone for many years, I suppose I can go on living
alone until the end of time.&rdquo; Then she added, a
twinkle again appearing in her grey eyes, &ldquo;and now
you know all.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_202">[202]</div>
<p>&ldquo;O, Aunt Jane, then you <i>did</i> write those messages
and leave them for us to find?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I plead guilty,&rdquo; the old woman confessed. &ldquo;I
overheard you and Nann saying that you wished
something mysterious would happen. I had been
wondering when to tell you the story, and I decided
to wait until I heard from the lawyer. I know you
are wondering how Gibralter Strait happened to
give you that last message the very day a letter
came telling about the stock. That is very simple.
One day when Mr. Strait came for a grocery order,
you were all away somewhere. I gave him that last
message and told him to keep it in our box at the
office until a letter should arrive from my lawyer,
then they were to be brought over and that letter
was to be given to you girls.&rdquo; The old woman
leaned back in her chair and it was quite evident that
her recent emotion had nearly exhausted her. Nann,
excusing herself thoughtfully, left the other two
alone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dori,&rdquo; the old woman said tenderly, &ldquo;as you
grow older, don&rsquo;t let circumstances of any nature
make you cold and critical. If I had been loving
and kind when your girl mother married my boy,
my life, instead of being bleak and barren, would
have been a happy one. No one knows how I have
grieved; how my unkindness has haunted me.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_203">[203]</div>
<p>Just then Dories thought of her sweet-faced
mother who had borne the trials of poverty so
bravely, and again she heard her saying, &ldquo;The only
ghosts that haunt us are the memories of loving
words that might have been spoken and loving deeds
that might have been done.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Impulsively the girl leaned over and kissed the
wrinkled face. &ldquo;I love you, Aunt Jane,&rdquo; she whispered.
&ldquo;And I shall beg Mother to let us all live
together in your home, if it is still your wish.&rdquo;
Then, as Miss Moore had risen, seeming suddenly
feeble, Dories sprang up and helped her to her room
and remained there until the old woman was in
her bed.</p>
<p>When the girl went out to the kitchen where her
friend was preparing supper, she exclaimed, half
laughing and half crying: &ldquo;Nann Sibbett, I&rsquo;m so
brimming full of conflicting emotions, I don&rsquo;t feel
at all real. Pinch me, please, and see if I am.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Instead I&rsquo;ll give you a hard hug; a congratulatory
one. There! Did that seem real?&rdquo; Then
Nann added in her most sensible, matter-of-fact
voice: &ldquo;Now, wake up, Dori. You mustn&rsquo;t go
around in a trance. Of course the only mystery that
<i>you</i> are interested in is solved, and wonderfully
solved, but I&rsquo;m just as keen as ever to know the
secret the old ruin is holding.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_204">[204]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll try to be!&rdquo; Dories promised, then confessed:
&ldquo;But, honestly, I am not a bit curious about any
mystery, now that my own is solved.&rdquo; A moment
later she asked: &ldquo;Nann, do you suppose Mother will
want me to come home right away?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, I shouldn&rsquo;t think so, Dori,&rdquo; her friend replied.
&ldquo;You always hear from your mother on
Friday, so wait and see what tomorrow brings.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The morrow was to hold much of interest for
both of the girls.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_205">[205]</div>
<h2 id="c25"><br />CHAPTER XXV.
<br />PUZZLED AGAIN</h2>
<p>As soon as their breakfast was over, Dories asked
her Aunt if she were willing that the girls go to
Siquaw Center for the mail. &ldquo;I always get a letter
from Mother on the Friday morning train,&rdquo; was the
excuse she gave, &ldquo;and, of course, I am simply wild
to hear what she will have to say today; that is, if
she does know about&mdash;well, about what you told us
that father&rsquo;s lawyer had written.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss Moore was glad to be alone, for she had
had a sleepless night. She had long dreamed that,
perhaps, when she became acquainted with her niece,
that young person might be able to influence the
stubborn mother to accept the home that the old
woman had offered, and that peace might again be
restored to the lonely, repentant heart. But now,
just as that dream seemed about to be fulfilled, the
mother was placed in a position of complete independence,
and so, of course, she would never be willing
to share the home of her husband&rsquo;s great-aunt.
The desolate loneliness of the years ahead, however
few they might be, depressed the old woman greatly.
Dories, seeing tears in the grey eyes, stooped impulsively,
and, for the second time, she kissed her
great-aunt. &ldquo;If you will let me, I&rsquo;m coming to visit
you often,&rdquo; she whispered, as though she had read
her aunt&rsquo;s thoughts. Then away the two girls went.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_206">[206]</div>
<p>It was a glorious morning and they skipped along
as fast as they could on the sandy road. Mrs. Strait,
with a baby on one arm, was tending the general
store and post office when the girls entered. No one
else was in sight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good morning, Mrs. Strait. Is there any mail
for Miss Dories Moore?&rdquo; that young maiden inquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yeah, thar is, an&rsquo; a picher card for tother young
miss,&rdquo; was the welcome reply.</p>
<p>Dories fairly pounced on the letter that was
handed her. &ldquo;Good, it <i>is</i> from Mother! I am almost
sure that she will want me to come home,&rdquo; she exclaimed
gleefully. But when the message had been
read, Dories looked up with a puzzled expression.
&ldquo;How queer!&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Mother doesn&rsquo;t say one
thing about the stock; not even that she has heard
about it, but she does say that she and Brother are
leaving today on a business journey and that she
may not write again for some time. I&rsquo;ll read you
what she says at the end: &lsquo;Daughter dear, if your
Aunt Jane wishes to return to Boston before you
again hear from me, I would like you to remain with
her until I send for you. Peter is standing at my
elbow begging me to tell you that he is going to
travel on a train just as you did. I judge from
your letters that you and Nann are having an interesting
time after all, but, of course, you would be
happy, I am sure, anywhere with Nann!&rsquo;&rdquo; Dories
looked up questioningly. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think it is very
strange that Mother should go somewhere and not
tell me where or why?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_207">[207]</div>
<p>Nann laughed. &ldquo;Maybe she thought that she
would add another mystery to those we are trying
to solve,&rdquo; she suggested, but Dories shook her head.
&ldquo;No, that wasn&rsquo;t Mother&rsquo;s reason. Perhaps&mdash;O,
well, what&rsquo;s the use of guessing? Who was your
card from?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dad, of course. I judge that he will be glad
when his daughter returns. O, Dori,&rdquo; Nann interrupted
herself to exclaim, &ldquo;do look at that pair of
black eyes peering at us out of that bundle!&rdquo; She
nodded toward the baby, wrapped in a blanket, that
had been placed in a basket on the counter.</p>
<p>The girls leaned over the little creature, who
actually tried to talk to them but ended its chatter
with a cracked little crow. &ldquo;He ain&rsquo;t a mite like
Gib,&rdquo; the pleased mother told them. &ldquo;The rest of
us is sandy complected, but this un is black as a
crow, an&rsquo; jest as jolly all the time as yo&rsquo;uns see him
now.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_208">[208]</div>
<p>&ldquo;What is the little fellow&rsquo;s name, Mrs. Strait?&rdquo;
Nann asked.</p>
<p>The woman looked anxiously toward the door;
then said in a low voice: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m wantin&rsquo; to give the
little critter a Christian name&mdash;Moses, Jacop, or
the like, but his Pa is set on the notion of namin&rsquo;
&rsquo;em all after geography straits, an&rsquo; I ain&rsquo;t one to
hold out about nothin&rsquo;.&rdquo; She sighed. &ldquo;But it&rsquo;s long
past time to christen the poor little mite.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nann and Dories tried hard not to let their mirth
show in their faces. The older girl inquired: &ldquo;Why
hasn&rsquo;t he been christened, Mrs. Strait? Can&rsquo;t you
decide on a name?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wall, yo&rsquo; see it&rsquo;s this a-way,&rdquo; the gaunt, angular
woman explained. &ldquo;Gib didn&rsquo;t fetch home his
geography books, an&rsquo; school don&rsquo;t open up till snow
falls in these here parts. So baby&rsquo;ll have to wait,
I reckon, bein&rsquo; as Gib don&rsquo;t recollect no strait
names.&rdquo; Then, with hope lighting her plain face,
the woman asked: &ldquo;Do you girls know any of them
geography names?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dories and Nann looked at each other blankly.
&ldquo;Why, there is Magellan,&rdquo; one said. &ldquo;And Dover,&rdquo;
the other supplemented.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_209">[209]</div>
<p>Mrs. Strait looked pleased. &ldquo;Seems like that thar
Dover one ought to do as wall as any. Please to
write it down so&rsquo;s Pa kin see it an&rsquo; tother un along
side of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girls left the store as soon as they could,
fearing that they would have to laugh, and they did
not want to hurt the mother&rsquo;s feelings, and so, after
purchasing some chocolate bars, they darted away
without having learned where Gib was.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not that it matters,&rdquo; Nann said when they were
nearing the beach. &ldquo;He won&rsquo;t come over, probably,
until tomorrow morning with Dick.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But Dick said he would arrive on Friday,&rdquo;
Dories reminded her friend.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I know, but if he leaves Boston after school
is out in the afternoon, he won&rsquo;t get there until
evening.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They might come over then,&rdquo; Dories insisted.
A few moments later, as they were nearing the
cabin, she added: &ldquo;There is no appetizing aroma to
greet us today. Aunt Jane is probably still in bed.&rdquo;
Then, turning toward Nann, the younger girl said
earnestly: &ldquo;Truly, I feel so sorry for her. She
seems heartbroken to think that Mother and Peter
and I will not need to share her home. I believe she
fretted about it all night; she looked so hollow-eyed
and sick this morning.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_210">[210]</div>
<p>Dories was right. The old woman was still in
bed, and when her niece went in to see what she
wanted, Miss Moore said: &ldquo;Will you girls mind so
very much if we go home on Monday. I am not
feeling at all well, and, if I am in Boston I can send
for a doctor. Here I might die before one could
reach me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course we want to go whenever you wish,&rdquo;
Dories declared. She did not mention what her
mother had written. There would be time enough
later.</p>
<p>Out in the kitchen Dories talked it over with
Nann. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll be sorry to go before you solve the
mystery of the old ruin, won&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; the younger
girl asked.</p>
<p>Nann whirled about, eyes laughing, stove poker
upheld. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll prophesy that the mystery will all be
solved before our train leaves on Monday morning,&rdquo;
she said merrily.</p>
<p>After her lunch, which this time truly was of toast
and tea, Miss Moore said that she felt as though she
could sleep all the afternoon if she were left alone,
and so Dories and Nann donned their bright-colored
tams and sweater-coats, as there was a cool wind,
and went out on the beach wondering where they
would go and what they would do. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s visit the
punt and see that nothing has happened to it,&rdquo;
Dories suggested.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_211">[211]</div>
<p>They soon reached the end of the sandy road.
Nann glanced casually in the direction of Siquaw,
then stopped and, narrowing her eyes, she gazed
steadily into the distance for a long moment. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t
you see a moving object coming this way?&rdquo; she
inquired.</p>
<p>Dories nodded as she declared: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s old Spindly,
of course, and I suppose Gib is on it. I wonder why
he is coming over at this hour. It isn&rsquo;t later than
two, is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not that even.&rdquo; Dories glanced at her wrist-watch
as she spoke. For another long moment they
stood watching the object grow larger. Not until it
was plain to them that it was the old white horse
with two riders did they permit their delight to be
expressed. &ldquo;Dick has come! He must have arrived
on the noon train. It must be a holiday!&rdquo; Dories
exclaimed, and Nann added, &ldquo;Or at least Dick has
proclaimed it one.&rdquo; Then they both waved for the
boys, having observed them from afar, were swinging
their caps.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it great that I could come today?&rdquo; was
Dick&rsquo;s first remark after the greetings had been exchanged.
&ldquo;Class having exams and I was exempt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nann&rsquo;s eyes glowed. &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t that splendid, Dick?
I know what that means. Your daily average was
so high you were excused from the test.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_212">[212]</div>
<p>The city boy flushed. &ldquo;Well, it wasn&rsquo;t my fault.
It&rsquo;s an easy subject for me. I&rsquo;m wild about history
and I don&rsquo;t seem able to forget anything that I
read.&rdquo; Then, smiling at the country boy, he added:
&ldquo;Gib, here, tells me that you haven&rsquo;t visited the old
ruin since I left. That was mighty nice of you.
I&rsquo;ve been thinking so much about that mysterious
airplane chap this past week, it&rsquo;s a wonder I could
get any of my lessons right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it the queerest thing?&rdquo; Nann said. &ldquo;That
airplane hasn&rsquo;t been seen or heard since you left.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t so sure.&rdquo; Gib had removed his cap and
was scratching one ear as he did when puzzled.
&ldquo;Pa &rsquo;n&rsquo; me both thought we heard a hummin&rsquo; one
night, but &rsquo;twas far off, sort o&rsquo;. I reckon&rsquo;d, like&rsquo;s
not, that pilot fellar lit his boat way out in the water
and slid back in quiet-like.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dick, much interested, nodded. &ldquo;He could have
done that, you know. He may realize that there are
people on the point and he may not wish to have his
movements observed.&rdquo; Then eagerly: &ldquo;Can you
girls go right now? The tide is just right and we
wanted to give that old dining-room a thorough
overhauling, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_213">[213]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, we can go. Aunt Jane is going to sleep all
of the afternoon.&rdquo; Then impulsively Dories turned
toward the red-headed boy. &ldquo;Gib,&rdquo; she exclaimed
contritely, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m just ever so sorry that I called Aunt
Jane queer or cross. Something happened this week
which has proved that she is very different in her
heart from what we supposed her to be. She has
just been achingly lonely for years, and some family
affairs which, of course, would interest no one but
ourselves, have made her shut herself away from
everyone. I&rsquo;m ever so sorry for her, and I know
that from now on I&rsquo;m going to love her just dearly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So am I,&rdquo; Nann said very quietly. &ldquo;I wish we
had realized that all this time Miss Moore has been
hungering for us to love and be kind to her. We
girls sometimes forget that elderly people have much
the same feelings that we have.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; Dick agreed as they walked four
abreast toward the creek where the punt was hid, &ldquo;I
have an old grandmother who is always so happy
when we youngsters include her in our good times.&rdquo;
Then he added in a changed tone: &ldquo;Hurray! There&rsquo;s
the old punt! Now, all aboard!&rdquo; Ever chivalrous,
Dick held out a hand to each girl, but it was to Nann
that he said with conviction: &ldquo;This is the day that
we are to solve the mystery.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_214">[214]</div>
<h2 id="c26"><br />CHAPTER XXVI.
<br />A CLUE TO THE OLD RUIN MYSTERY</h2>
<p>The voyage up the narrow channel in the marsh
was uneventful and at last the four young people
reached the opening near the old ruin. They stopped
before entering to look around that they might be
sure the place was unoccupied. Then Dick crept
through the opening in the crumbling wall to reconnoiter.
&ldquo;All&rsquo;s well!&rdquo; he called to them a moment
later, and in the same order as before the others
followed. Everything was just as it had been on
their former visit.</p>
<p>Dick flashed his light in the corner where they
had seen the picture of old Colonel Wadbury, and
the sharp eyes, under heavy brows, seemed to glare
at them. Dories, with a shudder, was secretly glad
that they were only pictured eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sh! Hark!&rdquo; It was Dick in the lead who, having
stopped, turned and held up a warning finger.
They had reached the door out of which they had
broken a panel the week before.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it? What do you hear?&rdquo; Nann asked.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_215">[215]</div>
<p>&ldquo;A sort of a scurrying noise,&rdquo; Dick told her.
&ldquo;Nothing but rats, I guess, but just the same you
girls had better wait here until Gib and I have looked
around in there. Perhaps you&rsquo;d better go back to
the opening,&rdquo; he added as, in the dim light, he noted
Dories&rsquo; pale, frightened face. The younger girl was
clutching her friend&rsquo;s arm as though she never
meant to let go. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m just as afraid of rats,&rdquo; she
confessed, &ldquo;as I am of ghosts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll wait here,&rdquo; Nann said calmly. &ldquo;Rats
won&rsquo;t hurt us. They would be more afraid of us
than even Dori is of them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dick climbed through the hole in the door, followed
closely by Gib. Nann, holding a lighted
lantern, smiled at her friend reassuringly. Although
only a few moments passed, they seemed like an
eternity to the younger girl; then Dick&rsquo;s beaming
face appeared in the opening. It was very evident
that he had found something which interested him
and which was not of a frightening nature. The
boys assisted the girls over the heap of debris which
held the door shut and then flashed the light around
what had once been a handsomely furnished dining-room.
Dories&rsquo; first glance was toward the sideboard
where they had left the painting of the beautiful
girl. It was not there.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_216">[216]</div>
<p>The boys also had made the discovery. &ldquo;Which
proves,&rdquo; Dick declared, &ldquo;that Gib was right about
that airplane chap having been here. He must have
taken the picture, but <i>why</i> do you suppose he would
want it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess you&rsquo;re right,&rdquo; Dick had been looking
behind the heavy piece of mahogany furniture as
he spoke, &ldquo;and, whoever was here has left something.
The rats we heard scurrying about were
trying to drag it away, to make into a nest, I
suppose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Arising from a stooping posture, the boy revealed
a note book which he had picked up from behind the
sideboard.</p>
<p>He opened it to the first page and turned his flashlight
full upon it. &ldquo;Those plaguity little rats have
torn half of this page nearly off,&rdquo; he complained,
&ldquo;but I guess we can fit it together and read the
writing on it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;October fifteen,&rdquo; Dick read aloud. Then paused
while he tried to fit the torn pieces. &ldquo;There, now I
have it,&rdquo; he said, and continued reading: &ldquo;At
Mother&rsquo;s request, I came to her father&rsquo;s old home,
but found it in a ruined state. The natives in the
village tell me there is no way to reach the place, as
it is in a dangerous swamp, sort of a &lsquo;quick-mud&rsquo;,
all about it, and what&rsquo;s more, one garrulous chap
tells me that the place is haunted. Well, I don&rsquo;t care
a continental for the ghost, but I&rsquo;m not hankering
to find an early grave in oozy mud.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_217">[217]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t recollect any sech fellow,&rdquo; Gib put in,
but Dick was continuing to read from the note book:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t let on who I was. Didn&rsquo;t want to arouse
curiosity, so I took the next train back to Boston.
I simply can&rsquo;t give up. I <i>must</i> reach that old house
and give it a real ransacking. Mother is sure her
papers are there, and if they are, she must have
them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The next page revealed a rapidly scrawled entry:
&ldquo;October 16th. Lay awake nearly all night trying to
think out a way to visit that old ruin. Had an inspiration.
Shall sail over it in an airplane and get
at least a bird&rsquo;s-eye view. Glad I belong to the
Boston Aviation Club.</p>
<p>&ldquo;October 18. Did the deed! Sailed over Siquaw
in an aircraft and saw, when I flew low, that there
was a narrow channel leading through the marsh
and directly up to the old ruin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll come in a seaplane next time, with a small
boat on board. Mother&rsquo;s coming soon and I want
to find the deed to the Wetherby place before she
arrives. It is her right to have it since her own
mother left it to her, but her father, I just can&rsquo;t call
the old skinflint my grandfather, had it hidden in
the house that he built by the sea. When Mother
went back, she asked for that deed, but he wouldn&rsquo;t
give it to her. She told him that her husband was
dead and that she wanted to live in her mother&rsquo;s old
home near Boston, but he said that she never should
have it, that he had destroyed the deed. He was
mean enough to do it, without doubt, but I don&rsquo;t
believe he did it, somehow. I have a hunch that the
papers are still there.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_218">[218]</div>
<p>&ldquo;October 20. Well, I went in a seaplane, made
my way up that crooked little channel in the swamp.
Found more in the ruin than I had supposed I would.
First of all, I hunted for an old chest, or writing
desk, the usual place for papers to be kept. Located
a heavy walnut desk in what had once been a library,
but though there were papers enough, nothing like a
deed. Had a mishap. Had left the seaplane anchored
in a quiet cove. It broke loose and washed ashore.
Wasn&rsquo;t hurt, but I couldn&rsquo;t get it off until change
of tide, along about midnight. Being curious about
a rocky point, I took my flashlight and prowled
around a bit. Saw eight boarded-up cottages in a
row, and to pass away the time I looked them over.
Was rather startled by two occurrences. First was
a noise regularly repeated, but that proved to be
only a blind on an upper window banging in the
wind. That was the cottage nearest the point. Then
later I was sure I saw two white faces in an upper
window of a cottage farther along. Sort of surprising
when you suppose you&rsquo;re the only living person
for a mile around. O well, ghosts can&rsquo;t turn me
from my purpose. Got back to the plane just as it
was floating and made off by daybreak. Haven&rsquo;t
made much headway yet, but shall return next
week.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_219">[219]</div>
<p>Dick looked up elated. &ldquo;There, that proves that
Mother did forget to fasten that blind,&rdquo; he exclaimed.
Dories was laughing gleefully. &ldquo;Nann,&rdquo;
she chuckled, &ldquo;to think that we scared him as much
as he scared us. You know we thought the person
carrying a light on the rocks was a ghost, and he,
seeing us peer out at him, thought we were ghosts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nann smiled at her friend, then urged Dick continue
reading, but Dick shook his head. &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t,&rdquo;
he replied, &ldquo;for there is no more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But he came again,&rdquo; Nann said. &ldquo;We know that
he did, because he left this little note book.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what is more, he took away with him the
painting of his lovely girl-mother,&rdquo; Dories put in.</p>
<p>Dick nodded. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you see,&rdquo; he was addressing
Nann, &ldquo;can&rsquo;t you guess what happened? When
he came and found a panel had been broken in this
door and the painting on the sideboard, he realized
that he was not the only person visiting the old
ruin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Even so, that wouldn&rsquo;t have frightened him
away. He evidently is a courageous chap, shouldn&rsquo;t
you say?&rdquo; Nann inquired, and Dick agreed, adding:
&ldquo;Well then, what <i>do</i> you think happened?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_220">[220]</div>
<p>It was Gib who replied: &ldquo;I reckon that pilot
fellar found them papers he was lookin&rsquo; fer an&rsquo; ain&rsquo;t
comin&rsquo; back no more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But perhaps he hasn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; Nann declared. &ldquo;Suppose
we hunt around a little. We might just stumble
on that old deed, but even if we did, would we know
how to send it to him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dick had been closely scrutinizing the small note
book. &ldquo;Yes, we would,&rdquo; he answered her. &ldquo;Here
is his name and address on the cover. He goes to
the Boston Tech, I judge.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O, what is his name?&rdquo; Dories asked eagerly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t you love to meet him?&rdquo; the younger
girl continued.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I intend to look him up when I get back to
town,&rdquo; Dick assured them, &ldquo;and wouldn&rsquo;t it be great
if we had found the papers; that is, of course, if
he hasn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nann glanced about the dining-room. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s
a door at the other end. It&rsquo;s so dark down there I
hadn&rsquo;t noticed it before.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boys went in that direction. &ldquo;Perhaps it
leads to the room where the desk is. We haven&rsquo;t
seen that yet.&rdquo; Dories and Nann followed closely.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_221">[221]</div>
<p>Dick had his hand on the knob, when again a
scurrying noise within made him pause. &ldquo;Like&rsquo;s
not all this time that pilot fellar&rsquo;s been in there
waitin&rsquo; fer us to clear out.&rdquo; Gib almost hoped that
his suggestion was true. But it was not, for, where
the door opened, as it did readily, the young people
saw nothing but a small den in which the furniture
had been little disturbed, as the walls that sheltered
it had not fallen.</p>
<p>One glance at the desk proved to them that it had
been thoroughly ransacked, and so they looked elsewhere.
&ldquo;In all the stories I have ever read,&rdquo; Dories
told them, &ldquo;there were secret drawers, or sliding
panels, or&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A removable stone in a chimney,&rdquo; Nann merrily
added. &ldquo;But I believe that old Colonel Wadbury
would do something quite novel and different,&rdquo; she
concluded.</p>
<p>While the girls had been talking, Dick had been
flashing his light around the walls. An excited
exclamation took the others to his side. &ldquo;There is
the pilot chap&rsquo;s entrance to the ruin.&rdquo; He pointed
toward a fireplace. Several stone in the chimney had
fallen out, leaving a hole big enough for a person to
creep through.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps he had never been in the front room,
then,&rdquo; Nann remarked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hate to suggest it,&rdquo; Dories said hesitatingly,
&ldquo;but I think we ought to be going. It&rsquo;s getting
late.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_222">[222]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll say we ought!&rdquo; Dick glanced at his time-piece.
&ldquo;Tides have a way of turning whether there
is a mystery to ferret out or not. We have all day
tomorrow to spend here, or at least part of it,&rdquo; he
modified.</p>
<p>At Gib&rsquo;s suggestion they went out through the
hole in the back of the fireplace. The narrow channel
was easily navigated and again they left the
punt, as on a former occasion, anchored in the calm
waters on the marsh side of the point. Then they
climbed over the rocks, and walked along the beach
four abreast. They talked excitedly of one phase
of what had occurred and then of another.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You were right, Dick, when you said that the
mystery about the pilot of the airplane would be
solved today.&rdquo; Nann smiled at the boy who was
always at her side. Then she glanced over toward
the island, misty in the distance. &ldquo;And to think that
that girl-mother and her daughter are really coming
back to America.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you suppose they will come in the Phantom
Yacht?&rdquo; Dories turned toward Gib to inquire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t reckon so,&rdquo; that boy replied. &ldquo;I cal&rsquo;late
we-uns saw the skeleton of the Phantom Yacht over
to the island that day we was thar, Miss Nann. A
storm came up, Pa said, an&rsquo; he allays thought that
thar yacht was wrecked.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If that&rsquo;s true, then everyone on board must have
been saved,&rdquo; Nann said. &ldquo;Of that much, at least,
we&rsquo;re sure.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_223">[223]</div>
<p>The boys left the girls in front of their home-cabin,
promising to be back early the next day. On
entering the cottage, Dories went at once to her
aunt&rsquo;s room and was pleased to see that she looked
rested. A wrinkled old hand was held out to the
girl, and, when Dories had taken it, she was surprised
to hear her aunt say, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m trying to be resigned
to my big disappointment, Dories; but even
if I <i>do</i> have to live alone all the rest of my days, I&rsquo;m
going to make you and Peter my heirs. Your mother
can&rsquo;t refuse me that.&rdquo; Tears sprang to the girl&rsquo;s
eyes. She tried to speak, but could not.</p>
<p>Her aunt understood, and, as sentimentality was,
on the whole, foreign to her nature, she said, with a
return of her brusque manner, &ldquo;There! That&rsquo;s all
there is to that. Please fetch me a poached egg with
my toast and tea.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_224">[224]</div>
<h2 id="c27"><br />CHAPTER XXVII.
<br />RANSACKING THE OLD RUIN</h2>
<p>It was midmorning when the girls, busy about
their simple household tasks, heard a hallooing out
on the beach. Nann took off her apron, smiling
brightly at her friend. &ldquo;Good, there are the boys!&rdquo;
she exclaimed, hurrying out to the front porch to
meet them. Dories followed with their tams and
sweater-coats.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve put up a lunch,&rdquo; Nann told the newcomers.
&ldquo;Miss Moore said that we might stay over
the noon hour. We have told her all about the
mystery we are trying to fathom and she was just
ever so interested.&rdquo; They were walking toward the
point of rocks while they talked.</p>
<p>Gib leaned forward to look at the speaker. &ldquo;Say,
Miss Dori,&rdquo; he exclaimed, &ldquo;Miss Moore&rsquo;s been here
sech a long time, like&rsquo;s not she knew ol&rsquo; Colonel
Wadbury, didn&rsquo;t she now?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_225">[225]</div>
<p>&ldquo;No, she didn&rsquo;t know him,&rdquo; Dories replied. &ldquo;He
was such an old hermit he didn&rsquo;t want neighbors,
but she did hear the story about his daughter&rsquo;s return
and how cruel he had been to her. Aunt Jane
wasn&rsquo;t here the year of the storm. She and her
maid were in Europe about that time, so she really
doesn&rsquo;t know any more than we do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We didn&rsquo;t start coming here until after it had
all happened,&rdquo; Dick put in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m so excited.&rdquo; Nann gave a little eager skip.
&ldquo;I almost hope the pilot of the seaplane has not
found the deed and that we may find it and give it
to him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So do I!&rdquo; Dick seconded. Over the rugged
point they went, each time becoming more agile, and
into the punt they climbed when Gib, barefooted as
usual, had waded out and rowed close to a flat-rock
platform. The tide was in and with its aid they
floated rapidly up the channel in the marsh. &ldquo;Shall
we enter by the front or the back?&rdquo; Nann asked of
Dick.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The front is nearer our landing place,&rdquo; was the
reply. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s give the old salon a thorough ransacking.
I feel in my bones that we are going to
make some interesting discovery today, don&rsquo;t you,
Gib?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dunno,&rdquo; was that lad&rsquo;s laconic reply. &ldquo;Mabbe
so.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_226">[226]</div>
<p>A few moments later they were standing under
the twisted chandelier listening to the faint rattle of
its many crystal pendants. Nann made a suggestion:
&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s each take a turn in selecting some place
to look for the deed, shall we?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, let&rsquo;s,&rdquo; Dories seconded. &ldquo;That will
make sort of a game of it all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dick held the flashlight out to the older girl. &ldquo;You
make the first selection,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>Nann took the light and, standing still with the
others under the chandelier, she flashed the bright
beam around the room. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a broken door
almost crushed under the sagging roof.&rdquo; She indicated
the front corner opposite the one by which
they had entered. &ldquo;There must have been a room
beyond that. I suggest that we try to get through
there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Dick demurred. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not sure that it would
be wise,&rdquo; he told her. &ldquo;The roof might sag more
if that door were pulled away.&rdquo; They heard a noise
back of them and turned to see Gib making for the
entrance. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be back,&rdquo; was all that he told them.
When, a moment later, he did return, he beckoned.
&ldquo;Come along out,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a way into
that thar room from the outside.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_227">[227]</div>
<p>He led them to a window, the pane of which had
been broken, leaving only the frame. They peered
in and beheld what had been a large bedroom. A
heavy oak bed and other pieces of furniture to match
were pitched at all angles as the rotting floor had
given way. Dick stepped back and looked critically
at the sagging roof, then he beckoned Gib and together
they talked in low tones. Seeming satisfied
with their decision, they returned to the spot where
the girls were waiting. &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t want you to run
any risk of being hurt while you are with us,&rdquo;
Dick explained. &ldquo;We want to take just as good
care of you as if you were our sisters.&rdquo; Then he
assured them: &ldquo;We think it is safe. Gib showed
me how stout the cross-beam is which has kept the
roof from sagging farther.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And so they entered the room through the window.
For an hour they ransacked. There was no
evidence that anyone had been in that room since
the storm so long ago. &ldquo;Queer, sort of, ain&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;
Gib speculated, scratching his ear. &ldquo;Yo&rsquo;d think that
pilot fellar&rsquo;d a been all over the place, wouldn&rsquo;t yo&rsquo;
now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go back to the front room again and let
Dori choose next for a place to search,&rdquo; the ever
chivalrous Dick suggested.</p>
<p>A few seconds later they again were under the
chandelier. Dories, as interested and excited now
as any of them, took the light and flashed it about
the room, letting the round glow rest at last on the
huge fireplace. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s where I&rsquo;ll look,&rdquo; she told
the others. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s see if there is a loose rock that
will come out and behind which we may find a box
with the deed in it.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_228">[228]</div>
<p>Nann laughed. &ldquo;Like the story we read when
we were twelve or thirteen years old,&rdquo; she told the
boys. But though they all rapped on the stones and
even tried to pry them out, so well had the masonry
been made, each rock remained firmly in place and
not one of them was movable.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, Dick, you have a turn.&rdquo; Dories held the
flashlight toward him, but he shook his head. &ldquo;No,
Gib first.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The red-headed boy grinned gleefully. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll choose
a hard place. I reckon ol&rsquo; Colonel Wadbury hid that
thar deed somewhar&rsquo;s up in the attic under the
roof.&rdquo; Dories looked dismayed. &ldquo;O, Gib, don&rsquo;t
choose there, for we girls couldn&rsquo;t climb up among
the rafters.&rdquo; But Nann put in: &ldquo;Of course, dear,
Gib may choose the loft if he wishes. But how
would you get there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gib had been flashing the light along the cracked,
tipped ceiling of the room. Suddenly his freckled
face brightened. &ldquo;Come on out agin.&rdquo; He sprang
for the low opening as he spoke. Then, when they
were outside, he pointed to the spot where the roof
was lowest. &ldquo;Yo&rsquo; gals stay here whar the punt is,&rdquo;
he advised, &ldquo;while me &rsquo;n&rsquo; Dick shinny up to whar
the chimney&rsquo;s broke off. Bet yo&rsquo; we kin git into the
garrit from thar. Bet yo&rsquo; we kin.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_229">[229]</div>
<p>Dick was gazing at the roof appraisingly. &ldquo;O,
I guess it&rsquo;s safe enough,&rdquo; he answered the anxious
expression he saw in the face of the older girl. &ldquo;If
our weight is too much, the roof will sag more and
close up our entrance perhaps, but we can slide down
without being hurt, I am sure of that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girls sat in the punt to await the return of
the boys, who, after a few moments&rsquo; scrambling
up the sloping roof, actually disappeared into what
must have once been an attic.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never was so interested or excited in all my
life,&rdquo; Nann told her friend. &ldquo;I do hope we will find
that deed today, for tomorrow will be Sunday, and
I feel that we ought to remain with your Aunt Jane
and put things in readiness for our departure on
Monday.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, so do I.&rdquo; Dories glanced up at the roof,
but as the boys were not to be seen, she continued:
&ldquo;I am interested in finding the deed, of course, but I
just can&rsquo;t keep my thoughts from wandering. I am
so glad that Mother will not have to keep on sewing.
She has been so wonderful taking care of Peter and
me the way she has ever since that long ago day
when father died.&rdquo; Then she sighed. &ldquo;Of course
I wish she hadn&rsquo;t been too proud to accept help from
Aunt Jane.&rdquo; But almost at once she contradicted
with, &ldquo;In one way, though, I don&rsquo;t, for if I had
lived in Boston all these years, I would never have
known you. But now that you are going to live in
Boston, how I do wish that Mother and Peter and
I were to live there also.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_230">[230]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe you will,&rdquo; Nann began, but Dories shook
her head. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe Mother would want to
leave her old home. It isn&rsquo;t much of a place, but
she and Father went there when they were married,
and we children were born there.&rdquo; Then, excitedly
pointing to the roof, Dories exclaimed: &ldquo;Here come
the boys, and they have a packet of papers, haven&rsquo;t
they?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nann stepped out of the punt to the mound as
she called, &ldquo;O, boys, have you found the deed?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t know yet,&rdquo; Dick replied, but the girls
could see by his glowing expression that he believed
that they had.</p>
<p>They all sat in the punt, which had been drawn
partly up on the mound and which afforded the only
available seats. Dick and Nann occupied the wide
stern seat, while Dories and Gib in the middle faced
them. Dick unfastened the leather thong which
bound the papers and, closing his eyes, just for the
lark of it, he passed a folded document to each of
his companions. Then he opened them as he said
laughingly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just four. How kind of old Colonel Wadbury
to help us with our game! Now, Nann, report about
yours first. Is it the Wetherby deed?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_231">[231]</div>
<p>After a moment&rsquo;s eager scrutiny, Nann shook her
head. &ldquo;Alas, no! It&rsquo;s something telling about
shares in some corporation,&rdquo; she told them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, we&rsquo;ll keep it anyway to give to our pilot
friend,&rdquo; Dick commented.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mine,&rdquo; Dories said, &ldquo;is a deed, but it seems to
be for this Siquaw Point property.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dick reported that his was a marriage license, and
Gib dolefully added that his was some government
paper, the meaning of which he could not understand.
He handed it to Dick, who, after scrutinizing
it, said: &ldquo;Well, at least one thing is certain, it
isn&rsquo;t the deed for which we are searching.&rdquo; Then,
rising, he exclaimed: &ldquo;Now it&rsquo;s my turn. I want
to go back to the salon. I had a sort of inspiration
awhile ago. I thought I wouldn&rsquo;t mention it until
my turn came.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They left the punt and followed the speaker to
their low entrance in the wall. Although they were
curious to know Dick&rsquo;s plan, no one spoke until
again they stood beneath the rattling chandelier. At
once the boy flashed the round light toward the corner
where the piercing eyes under shaggy brows
seemed to be watching them. Then he went in that
direction. Dories shuddered as she always did when
she saw that stern, unrelenting old face. &ldquo;Why,
Dick,&rdquo; Nann exclaimed, &ldquo;do you suspect that the
picture of the old Colonel can reveal the deed&rsquo;s
hiding-place?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_232">[232]</div>
<p>The boy was on his knees in front of the painting.
&ldquo;Yes, I do,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;At least I happened
all of a sudden to remember of having heard of
valuable papers that were hidden in a frame back
of a painting. That is why I wanted to look here.&rdquo;
He had actually lifted the large painting in the
broken frame. Dories cried out in terror: &ldquo;O, Dick,
how dare you touch that terrible thing? He looks
so real and so scarey.&rdquo; The boy addressed evidently
did not hear her. Handing the flashlight to Nann,
he asked her to hold it close while he tore off the
boards at the back.</p>
<p>For a tense moment the four young people
watched, almost holding their breath.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wall, it ain&rsquo;t thar, I reckon.&rdquo; Gib was the first
to break the silence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re right!&rdquo; Dick placed the painting from
which the frame had been removed against the wall
and was about to step back when the rotting boards
beneath him caved in and he fell, disappearing entirely.
Dories screamed and Gib, taking the light
from Nann, flashed the glow from it down into the
dark hole. &ldquo;Dick! Dick! Are you hurt?&rdquo; Nann was
calling anxiously.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_233">[233]</div>
<p>After what seemed like a very long time, Dick&rsquo;s
voice was heard: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m all right. Don&rsquo;t worry about
me. Gib, see if there isn&rsquo;t a trap-door or something.
I seem to have fallen into a vault of some
kind.&rdquo; Then after another silence, &ldquo;I guess I&rsquo;ve
stumbled onto steps leading up.&rdquo; A second later a
low door in the dark corner opened and Dick, smiling
gleefully, emerged, covered with dust and cobwebs.
&ldquo;Give me the light and let&rsquo;s see what this
door is.&rdquo; Then, after a moment&rsquo;s scrutiny, &ldquo;Aha!
That vault was meant to be a secret. The door
looks, from this side, like part of the paneling.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Dick!&rdquo; Nann cried exultingly. &ldquo;<i>That&rsquo;s</i>
where the Wetherby deed is. Down in that old
vault.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I bet yo&rsquo; she&rsquo;s right.&rdquo; Gib stooped to peer into
the dark hole.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t we all go down and investigate?&rdquo; Nann
asked eagerly.</p>
<p>Dick hesitated. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d heaps rather you girls stayed
out in the punt,&rdquo; he began, but when he saw the
crestfallen expression of the adventurous older girl
he ended with, &ldquo;Well, come, if you want to. I don&rsquo;t
suppose anything will hurt us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Although Dories was afraid to go down, she was
even more fearful of remaining alone with those
pictured sharp grey eyes glaring at her, and so,
clinging to Nann, she descended the rather rickety
short flight of steps. The flashlight revealed casks
which evidently had contained liquor, and a small
iron box. &ldquo;That box,&rdquo; Dick said with conviction,
&ldquo;contains the Wetherby deed.&rdquo; He was about to
try to lift it when Nann grasped his arm. &ldquo;Hark,&rdquo;
she whispered. &ldquo;I heard someone walking. It
sounds as though it might be someone in that library
or den where the desk was.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_234">[234]</div>
<p>They all listened and were convinced that Nann
had been right. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s that pilot chap, I reckon,&rdquo; Gib
said. But Dick was not so sure. &ldquo;Please, Nann,&rdquo;
he pleaded, &ldquo;you and Dories go out to the punt and
wait, while Gib and I discover who is prowling
around. I didn&rsquo;t hear an airplane pass overhead,
but then, of course, he might have come in from the
sea as he did before.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girls were glad to get out in the sunlight.
They stood near the punt with hands tightly clasped
while the boys went around to the back to enter the
opening in the wall of the den. It seemed a very
long while before Nann and Dories heard voices.</p>
<p>Then three boys approached them. A tall, slender
lad, dressed after the fashion of aviators, with a
dark handsome face lighted with interest, was listening
intently to what Dick was telling him.</p>
<p>The girls heard him say, &ldquo;Of course, I knew
someone else was visiting my grandfather&rsquo;s home,
especially after I found the painting of my
mother&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; He paused when he saw the girls,
and Nann was sure that the boys had neglected to
tell him that they were not alone. Dick, in his usual
manly way, introduced Carl Ovieda. Dories thought
the newcomer the nicest looking boy she had ever
seen. At once Dick made a confession. &ldquo;I know
that we ought not to have done it, Mr. Ovieda. We
read the note book that we found, hoping that it
would throw some light on the mystery.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_235">[235]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad you did!&rdquo; was the frank reply. &ldquo;The
truth is, I was getting rather desperate. You see,
Mother and Sister are to arrive tomorrow from
overseas, and I did so want to have the deed of
Grandma Wetherby&rsquo;s old home to give to Mother.
The place has been vacant for years, but the taxes
have been paid. Of course no one would dispute
our right to live there, but there couldn&rsquo;t be a clear
title without having the deed recorded.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gib asked a question in his usual indifferent manner,
but Nann knew how eager he really was to hear
the answer, &ldquo;Air they comin&rsquo; in that thar Phantom
Yacht, yer mother and sister?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The newcomer looked at the questioner as though
he did not understand his meaning; then turning
toward Nann and Dories he asked, &ldquo;What is the
Phantom Yacht?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nann told him. Then the lad, with a friendly
smile, answered Gib: &ldquo;No, indeed. That yacht was
sold, Mother told me, when we returned to Honolulu.
That is where we have lived nearly all of our
lives, but ever since my father died, Mother has
longed to return to her own home country.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_236">[236]</div>
<p>Nann, glancing at Dick, realized that he was very
eager to speak, but was courteously waiting until
the others were finished, and so she said: &ldquo;Mr.
Ovieda, I believe Dick wishes to tell you of an iron
box in which he is almost sure the lost deed will be
found.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The dark, handsome face lightened. Turning to
the boy at his side, he inquired: &ldquo;Have you really
unearthed an iron box? Lead me to it, I beg.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll wait in the punt,&rdquo; Nann told the three
boys. Dories knew how hard it was for her friend
to say that, since she so loved adventure.</p>
<p>However, it was not long before a joyful shouting
was heard and the three boys appeared creeping
through the low opening. Carl Ovieda waved a
folded document toward them. &ldquo;It is found!&rdquo;
Never before had three words caused those young
people so much rejoicing. After they had each examined
the paper, yellowed with age, and Carl had
assured them that he and his mother and sister would
never be able to thank them enough for the service
they had rendered, Nann exclaimed: &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know
how the rest of you feel, but I am just ever so
hungry.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_237">[237]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I have a suggestion to make,&rdquo; Dories put in.
&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s all go back to the point of rocks and have a
picnic.&rdquo; Then, as the newcomer demurred, the
pretty young girl hastened to say, &ldquo;Oh, indeed we
want you, Mr. Ovieda.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The tall, handsome youth went to the place where
he had left his small portable canoe and paddled it
around.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miss Dories,&rdquo; he called, &ldquo;this craft rides better
if there are two in it. May I have the pleasure of
your company?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Blushing prettily, Dories took Carl&rsquo;s proffered
hand and stepped in the canoe. Nann, Dick and Gib,
in the punt, led the way.</p>
<p>Half an hour later, high on the rocks, the five
young people ate the good lunch the girls had prepared
and told one another the outstanding events
of their lives. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m wild to meet your sister, Mr.
Ovieda,&rdquo; Dories told him. &ldquo;Does she still look like
a lily, all gold and white. That was the way Gib&rsquo;s
father described her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The tall lad nodded. &ldquo;Yes, Sister is a very pretty
blonde. She has iris blue eyes and hair like spun
gold, as fairy books say. I want you all to come to
our home in Boston just as soon as we are settled.&rdquo;
His invitation, Nann was pleased to see, included
Gib as well as the others. That embarrassed lad
replied, with a hunch of his right shoulder, &ldquo;Dunno
as I&rsquo;ll ever be up to the big town. Dunno&rsquo;s I ever
will.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_238">[238]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re wrong there, Gib!&rdquo; Dick exclaimed in
the tone of one who could no longer keep a most
interesting secret. &ldquo;You know how you have wished
and wished that you could have a chance to go to a
real school. Well, Dad has been trying to work it
so that you might have that chance, and, just before
I came away, he told me that he had managed to get
a scholarship for you in a boys&rsquo; school just out of
Boston. Why, what&rsquo;s the matter, Gib? It&rsquo;s what
you wanted, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was hard to understand the country boy&rsquo;s expression.
&ldquo;Yeah!&rdquo; he confessed. &ldquo;That thar&rsquo;s what
I&rsquo;ve been hankerin&rsquo; fer. It sure is.&rdquo; Then, as a
slow grin lit his freckled face, he exclaimed: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
hit me so sudden, sort of, but I reckon I kinder feel
the way yo&rsquo;re feelin&rsquo;,&rdquo; he nodded toward the grandson
of old Colonel Wadbury, &ldquo;as though I&rsquo;d found
a deed to suthin, when I&rsquo;d never expected to have
nuthin&rsquo; not as long as I&rsquo;d live.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girls were deeply touched by Gib&rsquo;s sincere
joy and they told him how glad they were for his
good fortune. Then Carl Ovieda sprang to his feet,
saying that he was sorry to break up the party, but
that he must be winging on his way. He held out
his hand to each of the group as he bade them good-bye,
turning, last of all, to Dories, to whom he said:
&ldquo;I shall let you know as soon as we are settled. I
want you and my sister to be good friends.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_239">[239]</div>
<h2 id="c28"><br />CHAPTER XXVIII.
<br />THE BEST SURPRISE OF ALL</h2>
<p>As the four young people neared the home cabin,
they were amazed to behold Miss Moore seated in
a rocker on the front porch and, instead of her house
dress, she had on her traveling suit. Dories leaped
up the steps, exclaiming, &ldquo;Why, Aunt Jane, what
has happened?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old woman replied suavely: &ldquo;Nothing at all,
my dear; that is, nothing startling. Mr. Strait drove
over this morning with some mail for me and I asked
him to return at two. Now hurry and pack up your
things. We&rsquo;re going home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dories put her hand to her heart. &ldquo;O,&rdquo; she exclaimed,
&ldquo;I was afraid there had been bad news from
Mother.&rdquo; Then, hesitatingly, &ldquo;I thought we weren&rsquo;t
going home until Monday.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are going now,&rdquo; was all that her aunt said.</p>
<p>Dories ran back to the beach to explain to the
three standing there, then the girls bade the boys
good-bye and hastened up to the loft to pack their
satchels and don their traveling costumes.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_240">[240]</div>
<p>&ldquo;What can it mean?&rdquo; Dories almost whispered.
&ldquo;There must have been something urgent in the
letter Aunt Jane received this morning,&rdquo; she concluded.</p>
<p>Nann snapped down the cover of her suitcase,
then flashed a bright smile at her friend. &ldquo;To tell
you the truth,&rdquo; she confessed, &ldquo;I am glad that we
are going today. Since your Aunt Jane will not
travel on Sunday, and since the mysteries have all
been solved, there would be nothing to do from now
until Monday.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Before the other girl could reply Nann, with eyes
glowing, continued enthusiastically: &ldquo;And how wonderfully
the old ruin mystery turned out, didn&rsquo;t it?
I feel ever so sure that Carl Ovieda and his sister
will prove good friends.&rdquo; Then, teasingly, &ldquo;Carl
seemed to like you especially well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dories&rsquo; surprised expression was sincere. &ldquo;Me?&rdquo;
she exclaimed dramatically, then shook her head.
&ldquo;Of course you are wrong! You are so much prettier
and wittier and wiser, Nann, boys <i>always</i> like
you better than they do your friends.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_241">[241]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I hold to my opinion,&rdquo; was the laughing response.
&ldquo;But come along now, I hear the rattly old
stage coming. If we are to make the 3:10 train,
Spindly will have to make good time.&rdquo; Nann
glanced at her wrist watch as she spoke; then, taking
their suitcases, they went down the rickety stairs.
On the front porch they found Miss Moore waiting
among her bags; her heavy black veil thrown back
over her bonnet. Gib&rsquo;s father, having left the stage
at the beach end of the road, was coming for the
baggage. &ldquo;O, Aunt Jane!&rdquo; Dories suddenly exclaimed,
&ldquo;aren&rsquo;t we going to put the covers on the
furniture and fasten the blinds?&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was Mr. Strait who answered: &ldquo;Me&rsquo;n Amandy&rsquo;ll
tend to all them things, Miss. We&rsquo;ll come over
fust off Monday an&rsquo; take the key back to the store.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss Moore nodded her assent. Then, with the
help of the two girls, she picked her way through
the sand to the stage and was soon seated between the
two black bags as she had been three weeks previous,
but now how different was the expression on the
wrinkled old face. On that other ride the girls had
been justified in believing her to be a grouchy old
woman, but today Dories noticed that when her aunt
smiled across at her, there was a wistful expression
in the grey eyes that could be so sharp and a quivering
about the thin lips. &ldquo;Poor Aunt Jane,&rdquo; was the
thought that accompanied her answering smile, &ldquo;she
dreads going back to her lonely mansion of a home,
but of course I am to remain with her for a few
days, or, at least, until I hear from Mother.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_242">[242]</div>
<p>When Siquaw was reached the girls saw that the
train was even then approaching the small station,
and, in the rush that followed, they quite forgot to
look for Dick and Gibralter to say good-bye. It was
not until they were seated in the coach, and the train
well under way, that Dories exclaimed: &ldquo;We didn&rsquo;t
see the boys! Don&rsquo;t you think that is queer, Nann?
They knew we were going on that train. I wonder
why they weren&rsquo;t at the station to see us off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A merry laugh back of them was the unexpected
answer. Seated directly behind them were the two
boys about whom they had been talking. Rising,
they skipped around and took the seat facing the
girls.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, where did you come from?&rdquo; Dories began,
then noticed that Gib wore his one best suit and that
he was carrying a funny old hand satchel. His
freckled face was shining from more than a recent
hard scrubbing. Nann interpreted that jubilant expression.
&ldquo;Gibralter Strait,&rdquo; she exclaimed, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re
going away to school, aren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; Then impulsively
she held out her hand. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know
how glad I am. I have great faith in you. I know
you will amount to something.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As the country lad was squirming in very evident
embarrassment, his friend drew the attention of the
girls to himself by saying: &ldquo;I suppose, Mistress
Nann, that you don&rsquo;t expect <i>me</i> to amount to anything.&rdquo;
The good-looking boy tried so hard to
assume an abused expression that the girls laughingly
assured him that they had some slight hope of
his ultimate success in life.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_243">[243]</div>
<p>Dories glanced across at the seat where her aunt
was sitting and, excusing herself, she went over and
sat with the elderly woman, although Nann could
see that they talked but little, her heart warmed
toward her friend, who was growing daily more
thoughtful of others. After a time Miss Moore said:
&ldquo;Dories, dear, I think I&rsquo;ll try to take a little nap. You
would better go back to your friends. I am sure
that they are missing you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then as the old lady did close her eyes and seem
to sleep, the four young people talked over the past
three weeks in quiet voices and made plans for the
future. &ldquo;I hope we will be friends forever,&rdquo; Dories
exclaimed, and Nann added, &ldquo;Perhaps, when we
have made the acquaintance of Mr. Ovieda&rsquo;s sister,
we can form a sort of friendship club with six members.
We could meet now and then, and have merry
times.&rdquo; Dories&rsquo; doleful expression at this happy
suggestion caused Nann to add, as she placed a hand
on her friend&rsquo;s arm, &ldquo;I know what you are thinking,
dear. That all the rest of us will be in Boston, but
that you will be in Elmwood. But surely you will
come to visit your Aunt Jane often during vacations.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_244">[244]</div>
<p>Before Dories could reply the boys informed them
that they were entering the city. Dories, who had
traveled little, was eager to stand on the platform at
the back of the car that she might have a better view,
and later when the young people returned to the
coach it was time to collect their baggage and prepare
to descend. First of all, Dick and Gib assisted
Miss Moore to the platform and then carried out her
bags. Then they hailed a taxi driver at her request.
Then Miss Moore surprised the girls by saying
hospitably: &ldquo;Come over and see us tomorrow, Dick
and Gibralter. You know where I live.&rdquo; She actually
smiled at the older boy. &ldquo;Dories will be with
me for a few days, I suppose, and Nann as well.&rdquo;
Then, when the older girl started to speak, the old
woman said firmly, &ldquo;You accepted an invitation to
be my guest for one month, and only three weeks of
that month have passed.&rdquo; This being true, Nann
did not protest.</p>
<p>Dories squeezed her friend&rsquo;s arm ecstatically. She
had dreaded the moment when Nann would leave
for the hotel where her father stayed. Gib lifted
his cap as he saw Dick doing when the taxi drove
away.</p>
<p>Then the old woman addressed the girls. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re
fine boys, both of them!&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s why I
was willing you should go anywhere with them that
you wished. I knew they would take as good care
of you as they would of their sisters.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_245">[245]</div>
<p>Dusk came early that autumn afternoon, and so,
try as she might, Dories could see little of the neighborhoods
through which the taxi was taking them.
It was a long ride. At first it was through a business
district where many lights flashed on, and
where their progress was very slow because of the
traffic. Then the noise gradually lessened, big elm
trees could be seen lining the streets, and far back
among other trees and on wide lawns, lights from
large homes flickered. At last the taxi turned in
between two high stone gate posts. Miss Moore
was sitting ram-rod straight and the girls, watching,
found it hard to interpret her expression. Dories
asked: &ldquo;Aunt Jane, have we reached your home?&rdquo;</p>
<p>They were surprised at the bitterness of the tone
in which the reply was given: &ldquo;Home? No! We
have reached my house. A place where there is only
a housekeeper and a maid to welcome you is <i>not</i> a
home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dories slipped a hand in her aunt&rsquo;s and held it
close. She wanted to say something comforting,
but could think of nothing. The taxi had stopped
under the portico by the front steps, and, when she
had been helped out, Miss Moore paid the driver.
Then they went upon the wide stone porch, followed
by the man, laden with their baggage. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t
understand why there isn&rsquo;t a light in the house. The
maids knew I was to return almost any day.&rdquo; Miss
Moore rang the bell as she spoke.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_246">[246]</div>
<p>Suddenly lights within were flashed on. The
heavy oak door was thrown open and a small boy
leaped out and hurled himself at one of the girls.
&ldquo;Dori! Hello, Dori!&rdquo; he cried jubilantly. &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s
Mother and me waiting to surprise you all.&rdquo; And
truly enough, there back of him was Mrs. Moore,
smiling and holding out her hand to the old woman,
who stood as one dazed. Then, comprehending what
it all meant, she went in, tears falling unheeded down
her wrinkled cheeks. She took the outstretched hand
as she said tremulously, &ldquo;My Peter&rsquo;s wife is here to
welcome me <i>home</i>.&rdquo; She was so deeply affected that
Mrs. Moore, after stooping to quietly kiss her
daughter, led the old woman into a formally furnished
parlor and sat with her on a handsome old
lounge. Then to the small boy in the doorway she
said, &ldquo;Little Peter, show Dori and Nann up to their
room.&rdquo;</p>
<p>What those two women had to say to each other,
no one ever knew, but that it drew them very close
together was evident by the loving expression in the
grey eyes of the older woman when she looked at
the younger.</p>
<p>Meanwhile the two girls, led by the small boy,
entered a large upper room which seemed to overlook
a garden. Like the rooms below, it was formally
furnished after the style of an earlier period,
but it seemed very grand indeed to Dories.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_247">[247]</div>
<p>Her eyes were star-like with wonderment.
&ldquo;Nann,&rdquo; she half whispered in an awed voice when
Peter had gleefully displayed the wardrobe where
the girls were to hang their dresses and had opened
each empty bureau drawer that they were to use, &ldquo;do
you suppose that Mother, Peter and I are to live here
forever?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure of it!&rdquo; Nann replied. &ldquo;And O, Dori,
isn&rsquo;t it wonderful?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Just then a bell in some room below tinkled musically.
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the supper bell,&rdquo; the small boy told
them. &ldquo;Hilda&rsquo;s the cook, and O, Dori, such nice
puddings as she can make. Yum! Jum!&rdquo; Then he
cried excitedly: &ldquo;Quick! Take off your hats. Here&rsquo;s
the bathroom that belongs to you. Honestly, Dori,
you have one all to yourself, and Mother and I, we
have one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girls smiled at the little fellow&rsquo;s enthusiasm.
Dories felt as though she must be dreaming. It all
seemed so unreal.</p>
<p>A few moments later they went downstairs and
found that Miss Moore, whose room was on the first
floor, had changed to a house dress. She was seated
in a comfortable chair by the fireplace, on which a
log was burning, and she looked content, at peace
with the world. She was saying to her nephew&rsquo;s
wife: &ldquo;I do love Dories; she is a dear girl, but I will
confess that I was disappointed because she does not
look like the lad I had so loved.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_248">[248]</div>
<p>Hearing a sound at the door, the old woman
turned, and for the first time really beheld the small
boy who appeared in front of the girls.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Peter!&rdquo; was her amazed exclamation; the light
of a great joy in her eyes. Then she pointed to a
life-size painting over the mantle in which was a
pictured boy of about the same age. &ldquo;They are so
alike,&rdquo; she said, with tears in her eyes, as she looked
up at Mrs. Moore, who, having risen, was standing
by the older woman&rsquo;s chair. Dories, gazing up at
the picture, thought that it might have been a painting
of her small brother except for the old-fashioned
costume.</p>
<p>The elderly woman was holding out her arms to
the little fellow, and, unafraid, he went to her trustingly.
&ldquo;My cup of joy is now full!&rdquo; she said, her
voice tremulous with emotion. Then, smiling over
the boy&rsquo;s head at his mother, she asked: &ldquo;Niece,
shall we tell our plan to the girls that <i>their</i> cup of
joy may also be full?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_249">[249]</div>
<p>Mrs. Moore nodded and the old woman continued:
&ldquo;Nann, your father has written to Dories&rsquo;
mother for advice. It seems that a change in his
business will take him traveling about the country
for at least a year, and he wanted to know what she
thought would be best for you. He was thinking
of sending you to some distant relatives, but we, my
Peter&rsquo;s wife and I, have decided to keep you as a
sister-companion for our Dori.&rdquo; Then, before the
girls could express their joy, the old woman concluded,
as she held little Peter close: &ldquo;And so, at
last, after many years of desolate loneliness, this old
house among the elms is to be a real <i>home</i>.&rdquo;</p>
